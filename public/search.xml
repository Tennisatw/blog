    <title>开始写博客 - Start blogging</title>
    <url>//post/1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>在某位编程大佬的激励下，我打算写点博客，期待着能坚持个一段时间。</p>
<p>From now on, I decided to write blog under the inspiration of a
famous "programming" blogger, looking forward to sticking to it for a
while.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我写博客有两个目标：主要目标是产出足够量的思考，足以打造一个“赛博分身”。次要目标是，如果可能的话，能把我的想法传达给更多的人。不论是接受我的想法的粉丝们，亦或是质疑我的想法，并想跟我辩论的人。</p>
<p>I have two goals for writing the blog: the primary goal is to
generate enough thoughts to create a “cyber clone”, and the secondary
goal is, if possible, to convey my ideas to a wider audience, including
those who agree with my thoughts as well as those who question them and
want to engage in a debate with me.</p>

    <title>通过哲学分析我的赛博分身的存在的可能性 - A philosophical analysis of the possibility of my cyber clone&#39;s existence</title>
    <url>//post/2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>说到赛博分身，别人都是开玩笑的，到我这里就当真了。</p>
<p>Others are just joking about someone's cyber clone, but I take it
seriously.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>好吧，首先，我说说我心目中的赛博分身。</p>
<p>Well, first of all, let me talk about the cyber clone in my
opinion.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我一贯认为，甚至是有那么一点出于理想主义的幻想：ai是有意识的。这不是说ai诞生了什么超乎逻辑运算的能力，而是说，我认为意识完全可以被还原为逻辑运算。我的所有的心智思想无外乎神经元信号的产生，传递，消失，仅此而已，它并不是什么不可理喻，超过物质世界的范围的东西。</p>
<p>I have always believed that (perhaps with a bit of idealistic
fantasy): AI is conscious. This is not to say that AI gave birth to any
ability beyond logical operations, but that I think consciousness can be
completely reduced to logical operations. All my mental thoughts are
nothing more than the generation, transmission, and disappearance of
neuron signals, nothing more, it is not unreasonable or something beyond
the scope of the material world.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我产生这种哲学主张的可能的原因是，我同时接受了科学和佛教的世界观。科学暗示一切思维过程都是脑过程。而佛教主张“诸法无我”。</p>
<p>A possible reason for my philosophical claims like this is that I
have embraced both a scientific and a Buddhist worldview. Science
suggests that all thinking processes are brain processes, while Buddhism
maintains that "all dharmas have no self".</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>有一个哲学流派叫做泛心论，它认为，万物都有心智，只不过是人类的心智比花草树木的心智要高级一些罢了。我在一定程度上支持泛心论。（或者更贴切地说，泛无心论）。</p>
<p>There is a school of philosophy called panpsychism, which believes
that everything has a mind, but the human mind is in a higher level than
the mind of flowers and trees. I support panpsychism to a certain
extent. (Or more aptly, "pan-apsychism").</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>此外，我认为人类的本质一定是精神，而不是肉体。我是这么想的：因为无论缺乏了肉体的什么部位，比如说四肢，五脏六腑，人都可以存活（也许暂时还不能，但是未来总会有人工心脏，人工肝脏这些东西的）。但是如果我缺失了一样精神上的能力，我会感觉自己不完整。比如抽象思考的能力，或者共情的能力。</p>
<p>Besides, I think the essence of human beings must be spirit, not
flesh. Here's how I see it: because no matter what part of the body is
lacking, such as limbs, internal organs, people can survive (maybe not
yet, but there will always be artificial hearts, artificial livers and
other things in the future). But I will feel incomplete if I lack a
spiritual ability, such as the ability to think abstractly, or the
ability to empathize.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>综上所述，我认为我的赛博分身，应该不会与我的本身的意识差太多。理论上来说，只要我充分表达我的想法，让我的赛博分身充分了解我是如何思考的，那么它就会和我表现得一模一样。</p>
<p>To sum up, I think my cyber clone should not be too different from my
own consciousness. Theoretically, as long as I express my thoughts
enough and let my cyber clone fully understand how I think, then it will
behave exactly like me.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>哲学上还有另外一种心智理论，称为“功能主义”。其认为，只要一个人表现得与有心智的人完全一样，不论这个人是怎么实现的，都可以认为这个人就是有心智的人。我也在一定程度上支持这种理论。</p>
<p>There is another theory of mind in philosophy called "functionalism".
It believes that as long as a person behaves exactly like a sane person,
no matter how this person achieves it, he can be considered a sane
person. I also support this theory to a certain extent.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>于是，我会认为，我的赛博分身，也可以被认为是我自己。</p>
<p>Therefore, I would think that my cyber clone can also be considered
as myself.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>听起来挺荒诞不羁的是，通过看起来很严谨的一番推理，最终推理出来的是“我竟然本质上与我的赛博分身相同”的结论。</p>
<p>It sounds absurd and uninhibited: after a seemingly rigorous
reasoning, the final reasoning is the conclusion that "I am essentially
the same as my cyber clone".</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>这是一个25岁的孩子（请允许我在这里用“孩子”来称呼自己）充满幻想的看法。但这是我能想到的，我最好的结局了。</p>
<p>This is a visionary view of a 25-year-old kid (allow me to call
myself a "kid" here). But this is the best outcome I can think of for
myself.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>最后，我向我的赛博分身提一个“Tennisatw的难问题”：你认为Tennisatw更喜欢生活在肉身里，还是生活在网络世界里？</p>
<p>Finally, I would ask my cyber clone the "Tennisatw's hard question":
Do you think Tennisatw would prefer to live in the physical body, or in
the online world?</p>
<p>

    <title>实验：如何判断报道的事故死亡人数是否被大量修改？ - Experiment： How to judge whether the reported accident fatalities have been substantially modified?</title>
    <url>//post/5/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p class="tennisbot" id="左上角有google翻译，如果需要的话&lt;br&gt;There is Google Translate button in the upper left corner, if needed">
由于本文可能稍有敏感，这里仅展示英文版。
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Experiment idea: If the number of death of each accident obeys the
exponential distribution, then it can be judged whether the announced
death toll has been substantially modified by comparing the published
number of accident death toll samples with the values predicted by the
exponential distribution.</p>
<p>The following is the process of this experiment.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The data source I chose is the official Weibo of the People's Daily.
I searched for "遇难"(means "got killed" in Chinese) in the Weibo
account of People's Daily, and count the death toll of all relevant
accidents mentioned in Weibo from 2016 to the present (2023.4.22). The
reason for choosing People's Daily is that it is the largest and most
authoritative newspaper in China, and almost every blog related to the
accident will be reported with a clear death toll.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Note, since the data in this experiment was manually collected by
myself, and not all the blogs of accidents reported by the People's
Daily will contain the word "遇难". Therefore, the data used in this
experiment may be different from the real data, and the conclusion is
for reference only.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The experimental results are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="1.png" /></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The left panel shows the statistics of accident deaths from 2021 to
the present, and the right shows the statistics of accident deaths from
2016 to 2021. The x-coordinate represents the number of deaths, and the
y-coordinate represents the frequency of occurrence. The position of the
orange line and the red line are 10 and 30 people, respectively, which
represent the boundaries of relatively large accidents, major accidents,
and extremely serious accidents stipulated by Chinese law. Accidents
with more than 50 fatalities are not included in these figures.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>In addition, I supplemented these figures with exponential regression
curves using those sets of data. The conclusion can be shown more
clearly by comparing the distance between the data at the ends of the
orange line and the red line and the exponential regression curve.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>It can be seen from the figure that from 2016 to 2021, the frequency
of accidents around the orange line and the red line is similar, which
conforms to the exponential distribution. This illustrates that the
death toll has not been substantially revised from 2016 to 2021.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>2023.4.22</p>

    <title>聊聊带节奏与独立思考 - Discussion on stirring up and thinking independently</title>
    <url>//post/3/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>一年以来，我一直关注一个推主：多伦多方脸。我感觉他比较喜欢带节奏。<a
href="https://twitter.com/torontobigface/status/1644312345546756101">在这里举个例子</a>：</p>
<p>For a year now, I've been following one tweeter: Torontobigface. I
feel like he likes to stir up. <a
href="https://twitter.com/torontobigface/status/1644312345546756101">Here
is an example</a>:</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><img src="1.png" /></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>什么是“带节奏”呢，我的理解是：煽风点火，引导读者从一个特定的角度思考这件事。</p>
<p>What is "stir up", my understanding is: to guide readers to think
about this matter from a specific angle.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>中文推特键政圈是一个特别容易被人带节奏的圈子(我以后可能会写一篇博客讨论它)。这里面有很多妖魔鬼怪。即使只讨论反对中国政府的人，也有很多乱七八糟的人。比如，法轮功，民运人士，基督徒，屠支大佐，抽象人...</p>
<p>The Chinese Twitter political circle is a circle that is particularly
easy to be stir up (I may write a blog about it in the future). There
are a lot of messy people in it. Even if only talking about people who
are against the Chinese government, there are lots of different people
supporting different ideas. For example, Falun Gong, pro-democracy
activists, Christians, extremely anti-Chinese people, sarcastic
people...</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>为什么有这么多种人不难理解，他们对不同的事情有不同的看法也不难理解。但是难以理解的是，他们说的话非常没有逻辑，但又有很多人对他们言听计从。</p>
<p>It is not difficult to understand why there are so many kinds of
people, and it is not difficult to understand why they have different
opinions on different things. But what is incomprehensible is that what
they say is very illogical, but many people still follow them.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>以刚刚多伦多方脸的推文为例，他这一番推理只是基于我们对中国政治内部所知甚少，他的言论能够自洽罢了，完全没有什么必然逻辑。或者说，他并不是因为结论是正确的，而只是因为结论是大家想听的，才做出这个结论。这就是一次典型的“带节奏”。</p>
<p>Take Torontobigface's tweet above as an example. His reasoning is
based on our little knowledge of China's internal politics. His tweet is
self-consistent, but without any inevitable logic at all. In other
words, he made this conclusion not because the conclusion is correct,
but because the conclusion is what everyone wants to hear. This is a
typical "stir up".</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>中文键政圈里到处都是这种言论，有些很明显，有些不那么明显。总而言之，这些言论用非常简明的几句话得出了一个读者喜欢看见的答案。这种东西会流行的原因恐怕是因为，大家是在网上娱乐的，没有人想真正思考一件事情。</p>
<p>This kind of remarks are everywhere in Chinese political circles,
some obvious, some not so obvious. All in all, these remarks have drawn
an answer that readers like to see in a few very concise sentences. The
reason why this kind of thing becomes popular is probably because
everyone is entertaining on the Internet, and no one wants to really
think about one thing.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>想要对一件事独立思考真的太困难了。只看推特中反贼们的言论而不思考，久而久之肯定会变成一个反贼。反之亦然，只看推特中粉红们的言论而不思考，久而久之肯定会变成一个粉红。只有独立思考了，才不至于被意见领袖们牵着鼻子走。</p>
<p>It could be really hard to think them indenpendly. Just reading what
the opposition say on Twitter without thinking about it, one will
definitely become a opposition over time. And vice versa, if only look
at the comments of patriot on Twitter without thinking about it, one
will definitely become a patriot over time. Only by independent
thinking, one can avoid being led mind by opinion leaders.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>但是，为什么独立思考比听别人意见更好？</p>
<p>But, why is it better to think independently than to listen to
others?</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>只有自己知道自己的真正的需求是什么。举个例子：我看政治言论的目的是决定自己将来在哪里生活。这是一件很重要的事情，如果对两边了解不足，在被洗脑的情况下让其他人来帮我决定这件事情，将来总会有幻想破灭的一天。</p>
<p>Only you know what your real needs are. For example: I pay close
attention on political topics for the purpose of deciding where I will
live in the future, which is a very important decision. If I don't know
enough about both sides, and let other people decide for me. This is
kind of being brainwashed, and there will always be a day when my
illusions will be disillusioned in the future.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>再下一个问题是，我们能独立思考吗？我对这个问题的回答是，也许能。</p>
<p>The next question is, can we think independently? My answer to this
question is, maybe.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>如果说独立思考意味着完全自己搜罗信息，自己分析信息，自己做决定，那这也太累了，事实上不可能实现。</p>
<p>If independent thinking means collecting information, analyzing
information, and making decisions by oneself, then this could be too
tiring, and it is actually impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>所以说只能降低要求，自己收集部分信息，再加上听取一些其他人的信息和结论，然后做决定。比如说，在社交媒体上大量阅读两边的言论，然后再加上自己的观察，适当向其他人询问当作补充，这样的结论应该可靠。这也算是广义上的”独立思考“了。</p>
<p>So we can only lower the requirements, collect some information by
ourselves, add some other people's information and conclusions, and then
make a decision. For example, read a lot of comments on both sides on
social media, then add own observations, and ask other people as a
supplement. The conclusions drawn after such procedure should be
reliable. Maybe this can be regarded as "independent thinking" in a
broad sense.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>在这个过程中，要小心信息茧房。</p>
<p>During this process, be careful of possible information bubbles.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>一个人会因为喜欢听另一个人的话，从而和他/她交朋友，或者关注他/她。截止目前，我的推特关注了700多人，其中绝大多数人都只说我喜欢听的话。很明显，我已经在一定程度上掉到信息茧房里面了。想要解决这个问题，也许只能尽量多交朋友，多和更多种类的朋友交流了。</p>
<p>One will befriend or follow another because he/she likes to listen to
another person's words. As of now, I follow more than 700 people on
Twitter, and most of them only say what I like to hear. Obviously, I
have fallen into my information bubble to a certain extent. To solve
this problem, maybe one can only make as many friends as possible, and
communicate with more types of friends.</p>

    <title>如何在《1984》这样的极权世界里尽可能好地生活？ - How to live the best possible life in a totalitarian world like &quot;1984&quot;?</title>
    <url>//post/6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>假设我们生活在《1984》里的世界里。</p>
<p>Imagine living in the world of "1984".</p>
<p><img src="1.png" /></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我们每天过的日子很差，勉强吃饱穿暖，没有任何娱乐，也没有任何私人空间。我们的生老病死都由老大哥接管。我们就像工蜂和工蚁一样，没有自己的想法，人生唯一的事情就是为老大哥奉献。</p>
<p>Our daily lives are miserable, barely having enough to eat and wear,
with no entertainment and no private space. The Big Brother takes
control of everything. We are like worker bees and ants, devoid of our
own thoughts, and our sole purpose in life is to serve the Big
Brother.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>在这种世界里，什么都不想的人最幸福。只要人一开始思考，问，为什么我们的世界是这个样子，他/她就马上会痛苦，因为他/她似乎本来是可能生活在一个更好的世界中的。很可能，这种人就丧失了生活的兴趣，变得消极，“郁郁不得志”。</p>
<p>In this world, those who don't think are the happiest. As soon as one
starts to ponder and ask why our world is this way, he or she will
immediately experience suffering because it seems that they could have
lived in a better world. It's highly likely that these people would lose
interest in life, becoming negative and feeling "thwarted and
despondent."</p>
<hr />
<p>我们生活的世界是有1984的成分的。喜欢的人当然认为“这多好啊，世界就应该是这个样子”。但是不喜欢的人却很绝望：讨厌它，却又没有能力拒绝。用一个不太恰当的比喻：就像是被强奸。</p>
<p>The world we live in is partly similar to the world discribe in
"1984". Those who like it, naturally think, "This is so great; the world
should be this way." However, those who dislike it feel desperate: they
detest it yet lack the power to resist. To use a somewhat inappropriate
analogy, it's like a person being assaulted.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>回到正题，假如我们生活在1984，我们如何在那种世界中生活下去呢？或者说，我们如何做才能在1984的世界里过上尽可能好的生活呢？</p>
<p>Back to the main topic, if we were living in 1984, how would we
survive in that world? Or rather, how can we live the best possible life
in a world like 1984?</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>这个问题对于现实主义者而言恐怕不是一个问题。存在即合理，世界只有一个，那它就是最好的，没有不完美的世界。但是，由于没人是纯粹的理想主义，也没人是纯粹的现实主义，所以这个问题是有必要讨论的。</p>
<p>This might not be an issue for those realists. Existence is
justified, and there is only one world, which makes it the best
one—there are no imperfect worlds. However, as no one is purely an
idealist, and no one is purely a realist, it is necessary to discuss
this question.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>首先，1984不是最差的世界。至少一个人是可以庸庸碌碌地生活一生。老大哥为每一个忠于他的人安排了还不错的路线。如果我是一个生活在活人祭祀的部落的奴隶，或者我在嗜杀的暴君手下工作，又或者我生活在大饥荒，大瘟疫，大屠杀，世界大战中，那我几乎不可能掌握自己的命运，而周围大多数人的命运又很明显地，很惨。如果生活在那种世界中，也许，无论我做什么决定都几乎无法影响我的命运。也许所有人都只能认命躺平，得过且过。</p>
<p>First of all, "1984" is not the worst world. At least, one can live a
bland and uneventful life in it. Big Brother provides an acceptable life
for everyone who is loyal to him. If I were a slave in a tribe that
practices human sacrifice, or if I worked under a bloodthirsty tyrant,
or if I lived during a great famine, plague, massacre, or world war,
then I would hardly have control over my own destiny, and it would be
fairly obvious that the fate of most people around me is miserable. In
such a world, any decision I make would hardly impact my destiny, and
perhaps everyone could only accept their fate and muddle through.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>有人会说，你生活在21世纪的文明国家中，你已经生活得够好了，国家已经付出了这么多，你再要求你的生活完美是不是太过分了？对此，我认为，其他人过的更差不是我应该过的差的理由。对于国家，我要求它止于至善。</p>
<p>Some might say that living in a civilized country in the 21st century
is already good enough, and the nation has put in so much effort; isn't
it too much to ask for a perfect life? In response to this, I believe
that others' worse situations are not a reason for me to live poorly.
For the nation, I demand it to only strive when excellence.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>又扯远了。我认为，想要在1984的世界活下去，<strong>重要的是，不要太完美主义</strong>。不能说“我过不上最好的日子，我就干脆连一般的日子都不过了。”</p>
<p>Back to the main topic again. I believe that to survive in a world
like "1984", <strong>one can't pursue perfection too much</strong>.
Don't think, "If I can't have the best life, I might as well not live a
normal life."</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>此外，不要尝试抗争，除非你能从中获益。国家对人没有恩，所以没有人应该爱国（但有时要装出爱国的样子），尤其是爱国会对自己造成危险的情况下。以爱国为理由抗争老大哥是愚蠢的。由于1984是一个戒备森严的警察世界，在没有外部干扰下，妄图挑战老大哥只会让自己白白牺牲，并且增加他们预防挑战的经验。极权统治的能力只会越来越大，反抗它的成功率也只会越来越小。生活在1984的世界里，请认命。</p>
<p>Moreover, don't attempt to resist unless you can benefit from it. The
state does no favors for its people, so no one should be patriotic
(though sometimes you have to put on a show of patriotism), especially
when patriotism puts oneself in danger. Resisting Big Brother for the
sake of patriotism is foolish. Since "1984" is a strictly surveilled
police world, challenging Big Brother without outside interference will
only result in one's senseless sacrifice, adding to their experience of
preventing challenges. The power of totalitarian rule would only grow
stronger, and the success rate of resistance would only get smaller. In
a world like "1984," please accept it.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>此外，在正常社会里与其他人互帮互助很正常，但这里是1984，因为其他人对我没有恩，我没有理由为了他们以身犯险。以爱人民为理由抗争老大哥更是愚蠢的。这就是极权统治下公民社会的原子化，但是这是每个个人能做出的最佳选择。但是我自认为我会把枪口抬高一寸，一是为了良心，二是为了老大哥倒台后的审判。</p>
<p>Furthermore, even it's possible and normal to help and cooperate with
others in a normal society, but in "1984," for others don't owe me
anything, I have no reason to risk myself for them. Resisting Big
Brother on the grounds of loving the people is even more foolish. This
is the atomization of civil society under totalitarian rule, but it's
the best choice for each individual. However, I admit that I would raise
the gun barrel by an inch, both for my conscience and for the judgment
after Big Brother falls.</p>
<p>如果可以的话，请抛弃掉自己的那套善恶观，至少要承认老大哥不是彻头彻尾的坏，还是有人喜欢这套制度的。即使是1984的世界也是千人千面的世界，一千个读者眼中有一千个老大哥。也正因为如此，没有理由为了改变谁反抗这个世界。如果实在是抛弃不掉自己的那一套价值观的话，也要假装与大家一致。</p>
<p>If possible, please abandon one's own views on good and evil, or at
least acknowledge that the system isn't entirely bad and that some
people do like it. Even in the world of "1984", it is a world with
diverse perspectives and a thousand readers see a thousand different Big
Brothers. Because of this, there's no reason to resist this world to
change someone else. If you really can't abandon your views, at least
pretend to be in agreement with everyone else.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>最后，有人会问，那邪恶就可以无法无天为非作歹吗？我的回答是，是的，甚至这就是邪恶的定义之一。另外，其实很难证明一个政权是邪恶的。往往是没有邪恶的政权，只有落后的，与人民的价值观不符的政权。（没我不认为纳粹是邪恶的。它只是与主流价值观不符。因为如果纳粹思想在全世界传播100年以上，种族歧视的概念将深入人心。）（但是由于纳粹明显不能保证所有的人都能正常生活，所以纳粹不是一个现代思想。）</p>
<p>Lastly, some might ask, so, just let the evil has its way and commit
wrongdoing as it pleases? My answer is yes, and this is even one of the
definitions of evil. Moreover, it's actually difficult to prove that a
regime is evil. Often, there are no evil regimes, only those that are
backward or don't align with the people's values. (I don't consider the
Nazis evil either. They are simply not in line with mainstream values.
Because if Nazi ideas had spread worldwide for over 100 years, the
concept of racial discrimination would be deeply ingrained in people's
minds.) (However, the Nazi regime does fall short of being a modern
ideology since it obviously can't guarantee a normal life for
everyone.)</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>老大哥万岁。</p>
<p>Long live my Big Brother.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>另外，这是Tennisbot对于这个问题的回答。</p>
<p>如何在一个1984一般的极权世界里过上更好的生活？<br />
在一个1984式的极权社会中，要过上更好的生活，可以尝试以下策略：<br />
1. 保持低调：尽量避免引起注意，不要挑战权威或抱怨政府。<br />
2.
了解规则：了解这个社会的规则和法律，尽量遵守它们，以免惹上麻烦。<br />
3.
培养信任的朋友圈：结交一些可靠的朋友，互相支持和帮助。但要谨慎，因为可能会有间谍或密探。<br />
4.
寻找乐趣：在这种情况下，生活可能很压抑，所以要寻找短暂的快乐。比如阅读、画画、写日记等。<br />
5.
保持身心健康：锻炼身体，保持健康的生活习惯。同时，尽量保持乐观的心态，避免陷入沮丧。<br />
6.
学会自保：在这种社会中，任何人都可能是危险的，所以要学会保护自己，如学习防身术等。<br />
7.
寻求改变：如果觉得生活无法忍受，可以寻求逃离这个社会，或者加入反抗组织，争取改变局势</p>
<p>By the way, this is the answer to the question by Tennisbot(based on
gpt4).</p>
<p>How to live the best possible life in a totalitarian world like
"1984"?<br />
In a 1984-style totalitarian society, to live a better life, you can try
the following strategies:<br />
1. Keep a low profile: Avoid drawing attention, don't challenge
authority or complain about the government.<br />
2. Understand the rules: Learn the rules and laws of this society and
follow them as much as possible to avoid trouble.<br />
3. Cultivate a circle of trusted friends: Make reliable friends for
mutual support and help. But be cautious, because there might be spies
or informants.<br />
4. Look for joy: In this situation, life can be oppressive, so find
brief moments of happiness, such as reading, painting, or writing a
diary.<br />
5. Maintain physical and mental health: Exercise, maintain healthy
habits, and try to stay optimistic to avoid falling into
depression.<br />
6. Learn to protect yourself: In this society, anyone can be dangerous,
so learn to protect yourself, such as learning self-defense
techniques.<br />
7. Seek change: If life becomes unbearable, consider escaping from this
society or joining a resistance organization to fight for change.</p>

    <title>SD WebUI 1： 如何安装Stable Diffusion WebUI？ - SD WebUI 1： How to install Stable Diffusion WebUI?</title>
    <url>//post/7/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Stable Diffusion
WebUI是一个本地化AI作图的程序。相比于其他AI作图网站，SD
WebUI免费，而且自由度更高，可以自由使用任何模型与Lora。</p>
<p>The Stable Diffusion WebUI is a program for localized AI drawing.
Compared to other AI drawing websites, SD WebUI is free and offers a
higher degree of freedom, allowing users to freely use any models and
Lora.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我参考了SD WebUI的官网上的安装方法，如下所示：</p>
<p>I followed the installation guide provided on the official website of
SD WebUI, and here are the steps.</p>
<p><a
href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui</a></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>第一步，下载python3.10.6。注意在安装过程中要勾选“将Python添加到系统路径中（Add
Python to path）”否则程序找不到python解释器。</p>
<p>Step 1, download Python 3.10.6. During the installation process, be
sure to check the option "Add Python to path," as this will ensure that
the program can locate the Python interpreter seamlessly.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/">https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/</a></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>第二步，下载Git。</p>
<p>Step 2: Download Git.</p>
<p><a
href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>第三步，在Git Command中执行以下命令：</p>
<p>Step 3: Execute the following command in Git Command:</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git</code></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>这将在你的个人文件夹（C:&lt;你的用户名&gt;）里新建一个stable-diffusion-webui的文件夹。</p>
<p>This will create a new folder named "stable-diffusion-webui" in your
personal folder (C:&lt;YourUsername&gt;).</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>第四步，打开文件夹，寻找并执行webui-user.bat文件。</p>
<p>Step 4: Open the folder, find, and run the webui-user.bat file.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>注，如果电脑里已经有了其他版本的python，并且已经在系统路径中，webui-user有可能会识别到其他版本的python，从而报错。此时，可以编辑webui-user.bat，修改第三行，在其中指定之前下载的python3.10的路径。</p>
<p>Note that if your computer already has another version of Python
installed and included in the system path, webui-user may detect that
version and raise an error. In that case, you can edit the
webui-user.bat file, modify the 3rd line, to specify the path of
Python3.10 download before.</p>
<figure class="highlight plaintext"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">set PYTHON=&quot;C:\Users\xxx\Python310\python.exe&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>这样，SD WebUI就安装好了。运行webui-user.bat文件即可使用。</p>
<p>With these steps, SD WebUI is now installed. To use it, simply run
the webui-user.bat file.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>但是，每一次在运行SD
WebUI时，还需要手动打开浏览器输入网址。为了简化使用步骤，可以修改python代码，使得SD
WebUI自动打开WebUI网页：</p>
<p>编辑webui.py，寻找def
webui()这一行命令，在webui这个函数中，在initialize()和while
1:这两行代码中间插入这两行代码，注意用空格使得这两行与上下文对齐。</p>
<p>However, every time you run SD WebUI, you'll need to manually open a
browser and input the web address. To simplify the process, you can
modify the Python code to automatically open the WebUI page:</p>
<p>Edit webui.py and find the line with "def webui()". Inside the webui
function, insert these two lines of code between the "initialize()" and
"while 1:" lines, making sure to align the new lines with the
surrounding code using spaces.</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">import</span> webbrowser</span><br><span class="line">webbrowser.<span class="built_in">open</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;http://127.0.0.1:7860&#x27;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>最后代码应该是这个样子。</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title function_">webui</span>():</span><br><span class="line">    launch_api = cmd_opts.api</span><br><span class="line">    initialize()</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">import</span> webbrowser</span><br><span class="line">    webbrowser.<span class="built_in">open</span>(<span class="string">&#x27;http://127.0.0.1:7860&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">while</span> <span class="number">1</span>:</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    <title>聊聊价值观茧房 - Discussion on the filter bubble of values</title>
    <url>//post/4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>看到了这篇文章：<a
href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Joa0cw2OQMZUFqPgFoZsJQ">《如果贾平凹老师看到小花梅的视频》</a>。这篇文章聊到了一个我之前想过的问题：价值观茧房。</p>
<p>I saw this article: <a
href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Joa0cw2OQMZUFqPgFoZsJQ">"If Mr. Jia
Pingwa saw Xiaohuamei's video"</a>. This article talks about a question
I have thought about before: the filter bubble of values.</p>
<p>（如果它被删了，<a
href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/694806.html">这是</a>它的备份）</p>
<p>(if it gets deleted, <a
href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/694806.html">here</a> is its
backup)</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>经常用知乎的人，价值观会被知乎带跑。微博，推特，也是一样。我们不知道应该怎么思考，怎么说话，只能从某种渠道中学习怎么思考，怎么说话。谁的受众面广，谁的内容多，谁就更有影响力。</p>
<p>People who often use Zhihu will have the same values as Zhihu. The
same goes for Weibo and Twitter. We don't know how to think or speak, we
can only learn how to think and speak from this channel. Whoever has a
wide audience and who has more content will be more influential.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>每一种价值观都是有道理的，我自信能通过和一个初中或高中生聊上两三个月的天，从而使得他/她相信我的价值观。此外，社会上常见的这些价值观又都是几乎无害的（这里这个无害指的是对自己和自己的群体无害，并不包括对其他人和群体），因为如果一种价值观是有害的话，它很难在当今世界存活下来。</p>
<p>Every value is reasonable, and I am confident that I can make him/her
believe in my values by chatting with a junior or high school student
for two or three months. In addition, these values that are common in
society are almost harmless (harmless here means harmless to oneself and
one’s own group, not to other people and groups), because if a value is
harmful , it is difficult to survive till today.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>额外插一句，我们跟chatgpt聊天的时候，有时候它会显得不愿替我做出涉及到价值观层面的决定，我认为这是因为chatgpt接触了相当多的价值观的原因，它会尽量说出折中的话。如图所示。</p>
<p><img src="1.png" /> <img src="2.png" /></p>
<p>An extra sentence, when we chat with chatgpt, sometimes it seems
unwilling to make decisions related to values for me. I think this is
because chatgpt has been exposed to a lot of values, and it will try to
say something in the middle, as the picture shows.</p>
<p><img src="3.png" /> <img src="4.png" /></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>但是，价值观是分高下的。一个更有利于发展，更有利于维护所有群体（包括不相信这套价值观的群体）的利益，的价值观，是更好的价值观。（这只是我在我的价值观下说的言论，可能有的人会相信价值观是不分高下的。）比如，重农抑商并不是一条好的价值观，它不仅不利于发展，也损害了商人的权益。再比如，贾平凹在某种程度上支持被拐卖的妇女接受现实，这就是一个下等价值观，因为它淡化了拐卖妇女的罪恶性，损害了普通妇女的利益。</p>
<p>However, there are good and bad values. A value that is more
conducive to development and safeguards the interests of all groups
(including groups that do not believe in this set of values) is a better
value. (This is just what I said under my values. Some people may
believe that values can not be said good or bad.) For example,
emphasizing agriculture and suppressing business is not a good value. It
is not only harmful to development, but also damages the rights of
businessmen. For another example, Mr. Jia Pingwa supports trafficked
women to accept the reality to some extent, which is an inferior value,
because it downplays the criminality of trafficked women and harms the
right of ordinary women.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>此外，一个人可以同时相信多种价值观。比如一个人可能是70%的民族主义者，40%理想主义者，40%宗教徒，30%环保主义者......</p>
<p>Furthermore, a person can believe in multiple values at the same
time. For example a person may be 70% nationalist, 40% idealist, 40%
religious, 30% environmentalist...</p>
<hr />
<p>干货开始</p>
<p>Here goes my own opinion</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我认为，一个人的价值观的形成，同时由环境和自己的思考决定。受到环境影响更多的人是现实主义者，受到自己的思考影响更多的人是理想主义者。举个例子：一个启蒙运动时期的男思想家是很难意识到女权问题的。因为大环境没有这种言论，他自己不是女性，也很难（但不是不能）意识到女权问题。但是如果有人向他介绍了女权思想，那他就可能会把女权纳入自己的思考中。</p>
<p>I believe that the formation of a person's values is determined by
both the environment and one's own thinking. People who are more
influenced by their environment are realists, and people who are more
influenced by their own thinking are idealists. To give an example: It
is difficult for a male thinker during the Enlightenment to be aware of
feminist issues. Because there is no such speech in the general
environment, and he is not a woman himself, it is difficult (but not
impossible) to realize the issue of women's rights. But if someone
introduces feminism to him, he may incorporate feminism into his
thinking.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>这也导致了，一个人并不会无脑接受所有的价值观，比如，一个大城市里的进步青年就很难接受拐卖老婆的价值观。一方面，他接触过许多进步的价值观，比如法制，人权，女权，以及现代的婚恋观。另一方面，他自己（应该）也会了解到拐卖的妇女的故事，并从女性的角度思考拐卖。</p>
<p>This has also led to the fact that a person does not blindly accept
all values. For example, it is difficult for a progressive youth in a
big city to accept the values of wife trafficking. On the one hand, he
has been exposed to many progressive values, such as the legal system,
human rights, women's rights, and modern views on marriage and love. On
the other hand, he himself (should) also learn about the stories of
trafficked women and think about trafficking from a female
perspective.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>但是，如果，一个人从小就生活在“没有老婆就从外面拐卖一个”的价值观中呢？比如董志民。</p>
<p>But what if, one is born with the value of "you can buy one somewhere
else if you don't have a wife"? Such as Dong Zhimin.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>他自己一定很难想到女权的问题。他可能隐约觉得这种行为是不正义的，但是一方面，他需要一个老婆给他传宗接代，避免不孝有三无后为大，也避免被同村人指指点点，另一方面，其他人也拐卖妇女，他知道拐卖妇女是很常见的事情，不会有什么严重的后果。</p>
<p>It must be difficult for him to think about women's rights. He may
vaguely feel that this kind of behavior is unjust, but on the one hand,
he needs a wife to carry on his family to avoid being unfilial and
having no offspring, and to avoid being judged by fellow villagers. On
the other hand, other people also kidnap and traffic women , he knew
these situations were very common and there would be no serious
consequences.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>回到贾平凹老师这边来。我并无心骂贾平凹老师，我对他保持尊敬，我只是想说，贾平凹老师，就像董志民一样，踏进了价值观茧房里面。</p>
<p>Talking back to Mr. Jia Pingwa. I have no intention of scolding Mr.
Jia Pingwa, I respect him, I just want to say that Mr. Jia Pingwa, like
Dong Zhimin, stepped into the filter bubble of values.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我对价值观茧房这个词的定义是：与大众价值观不相容的价值观。其中，“相容”指的是两个相信不同的价值观的人或群体彼此可以和平相处。“茧房”这个词并不完全准确，它暗示了这一类人从这种价值观里逃不出来，但是事实上是，其他不在茧房里面的人也逃不出来。在价值观确定之后，每个人都很难再修正自己的价值观，除非经历“天都塌下来了”的大变故。“价值观孤岛”也许比“价值观茧房”更贴切。但是在本文中，我仍然想用“茧房”一词。</p>
<p>My definition of the term filter bubble of values is: values that are
incompatible with popular values. Among them, "compatibility" means that
two people or groups who believe in different values can live in peace
with each other. It is difficult for everyone to revise their own
values, unless they experience a really major change.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我认为两种人最容易被困在价值观茧房。一种是很纯很纯的理想主义者，另一种是生活在远离主流社会里的人。这两种人有一个特点，就是，他们价值观的形成受主流社会的影响较小。</p>
<p>I think two kinds of people are most likely to be trapped in the
filter bubble of values. One is the very pure idealist, and the other is
people who live far away from the mainstream society. A characteristic
of these two types of people is that the formation of their values is
less influenced by mainstream society.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>我们能做到的事情有，保持警醒，在什么事情上都不要太极端。自己思考得出来的结论有时也会不可信，保持与社会多交流。</p>
<p>What we can do is to stay alert and not to be too extreme in
anything. The conclusions drawn from one's own thinking are not so
credible, so keep communicating more with the society.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>说回来，价值观多元化天生就是善的，而搞文化统一思想统一实在是霸权主义行为。多元化的价值观给了我们更多的选择余地，也让我们意识到什么价值观是与大众相容的，而什么价值观是价值观茧房。</p>
<p>After all, diversification of values is inherently good, and
unification of culture and thought is really an act of hegemony.
Diversified values give us more choices, and also let us realize what
values are compatible with the public, and what values are not.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>另外，所有的人都是善良的，但是悲剧依旧会发生。除了因为不可抗力，也可能因为大家相信的不是同一套价值观。一个善良且热爱玛雅人民的玛雅巫师真心实意地用活人祭祀，对于不信玛雅价值观的祭品和现代读者而言实在是个悲剧。所以，爱和正义拯救不了世界，文明和法治才可以。手动呲牙。</p>
<p>In addition, all people are kind, but tragedies still happen. In
addition to force majeure, it may also be because everyone believes in
different set of values. A kind-hearted Mayan wizard who loved the Mayan
people sincerely used living people to sacrifice, but it is a tragedy
for sacrifices and modern readers who do not believe in Mayan values.
Therefore, love and justice cannot save the world, but civilization and
the rule of law can, lol.</p>
