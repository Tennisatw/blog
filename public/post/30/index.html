</p>
<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>Before leaving office, Wen Jiabao stated: "We must not only advance
economic system reform but also political system reform. Without the
guarantee of political system reform, the achievements of economic
system reform may be lost, and the goals of modernization cannot be
realized."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Before leaving office, Li Keqiang said: "The Yangtze and Yellow
Rivers will not flow backward, and West Korea's opening-up will not
change."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I believe Li Keqiang's statement is more of a warning than a
guarantee: the West Korean nation is at a perilous moment. West Korea is
now at a crossroads, facing the choice between continuing reform and
opening up and modernization, or regressing to a closed and conservative
mode like North Korea. It's crucial for us to stand up and guide West
Korea towards the right direction.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="some-preliminary-theories">Some Preliminary Theories</h3>
<p>Without oversight, there's no reason for leaders to ensure the
nation's progress. If maintaining a North Korea-like state benefits
their wealth accumulation, why not do it?</p>
<p>Refer to Indonesia's Suharto, the Democratic Republic of the Congo's
Mobutu, and North Korea itself.</p>
<p>There's no evidence to prove that our leaders won't become
dictatorial like Suharto, exploiting the populace. Especially since that
was the case before the reform and opening-up.</p>
<p>The only way to prevent this is to strengthen the powers outside of
officials, enabling mutual supervision and checks and balances.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a nation, the political system influences the economic system,
and vice versa.</p>
<p>For a community, political power determines economic power, and vice
versa.</p>
<p>Everyone wants to strengthen their influence, reflected politically
as every organization with power wanting to maintain it. This leads to a
nation either being stuck in dictatorship or maintaining democracy for a
long time.</p>
<p>I think the biggest issue in West Korea now is that the leadership
(including the elites) has too much power, while the common people
(those not in the leadership group) have too little.</p>
<p>Enhancing the political power of the common people is crucial, and
some methods I can think of include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the economic status of the common people<br />
</li>
<li>Enhancing the political knowledge of the common people<br />
</li>
<li>Boosting the protesting capability of the common people<br />
</li>
<li>Uniting the common people</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>From my observation, the Party cares most about two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The long-term leadership of the Party (seemingly a lesson learned
from the dissolution of the Soviet Union)<br />
</li>
<li>The economic development of West Korea (Deng Xiaoping's
ideology)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't want to anger them, nor do I recommend anyone to resist it
forcefully. In fact, I believe that modernization and democratization
can help achieve these two goals.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To maintain the Party's leadership position, the Party chooses to
strictly control Party members, the military, and the media.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The leadership is composed of elites, but not all elites are part of
the leadership. "Elites" tend to look down on the common people,
inherently reluctant to share power with them, and believe that doing so
would lead to chaos.</p>
<p>Self-proclaimed elites among the common people might also side with
the leadership.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="the-people-we-trying-to-change">The people we "Trying to
Change"</h3>
<p>The people we "Trying to Change" (a softened term of enermies) are
the conservative faction within the Party, not any other political
groups, such as the Party's reformist faction, government agencies, the
West Korean people, official media, independent media, or those with
different political views (such as nationalists, orthodox Marxists,
extreme fans of the divine).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some groups, like the Party's reformist faction and independent
media, are clearly allies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My definition of the conservative faction within the Party (compared
to the reformist faction) includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who do not support reform and opening-up and the market
economy
<ul>
<li>No one openly opposes reform and opening-up, but some might be
hypocritical<br />
</li>
<li>This is unconstitutional<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Those who do not support freedom and democracy
<ul>
<li>Those who only support West Korean-style democracy but not
Western-style democracy are temporarily considered reformists<br />
</li>
<li>No one openly opposes freedom and democracy, but some might be
hypocritical<br />
</li>
<li>This is unconstitutional<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Those who do not support the rule of law and believe the Party is
above the law
<ul>
<li>This is unconstitutional<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Those who prevent West Korea from interacting with foreign countries
and isolate West Korea<br />
</li>
<li>Those who block communication between West Korea's lower and upper
classes<br />
</li>
<li>Those who prevent the public from supervising the government</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>The conservative faction within the Party is portrayed as
economically right-leaning (due to West Korea's unique form of
socialism), politically authoritarian, and culturally conservative,
which is entirely opposite to Marxism.</p>
<p>(They might see this as criticism, but I genuinely mean no criticism.
In the 21st century, it's reasonable for anyone to support any political
view.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The conservative faction has two major weaknesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development: The conservative faction allows for less creative
destruction, which suppresses economic construction and contradicts
their own goals. This has become increasingly apparent in 2023.<br />
</li>
<li>Morality: Even the conservative faction acknowledges the following:
<ul>
<li>West Korea is a socialist country (should with high welfare)<br />
</li>
<li>In West Korea, the people are the masters (democracy)<br />
</li>
<li>The conservative faction might also feel that West Korea is not
doing well in these areas</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the weak links within the organization are also their
weaknesses, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local governments in impoverished areas<br />
</li>
<li>The State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television<br />
</li>
<li>The Football Association</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: The conservative faction is not a single person; you can't
persuade them to relinquish power like convincing an emperor. Even if
the leader of the conservative faction is assassinated, others would
continue the same policies.</p>
<h3 id="motivation-for-reform">Motivation for Reform</h3>
<p>Reform requires the efforts of two forces: the reformist faction
within the Party and patriotic liberal civilians (people from all walks
of life).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The factional struggles within the Party are not public, but in
reality, these internal struggles are the main force pushing West Korea
towards democracy and modernization. The role of patriotic civilian
protests is limited to pressuring the conservative faction within the
Party.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The success or failure of West Korea's democratization depends on
whether the reformist faction within the Party can successfully seize
power. Xi belongs to the conservative faction and has already succeeded
in seizing power. It's almost impossible for West Korea to become
democratic before he steps down. Now, a strong reformist faction within
the Party is urgently needed to lead the struggle.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For patriotic civilians, the most willing to reform the current
system should be the <strong>elite civilians (intellectuals) and the
lower-class workers and farmers</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intellectuals are dissatisfied with the current situation</li>
<li>Workers and farmers are the biggest victims of the system</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if West Korea's economy continues to decline, everyone might
protest, like the White Paper Revolution</p>
<p>The more people participate in the struggle, the stronger it is, and
the post-struggle system can take care of more people.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="what-needs-to-be-done">What Needs to Be Done</h3>
<p>We must avoid direct confrontation, as it would be futile. Nor can we
afford to engage in tirades only to end up banned or silenced. It is
crucial to pinpoint and target specific errors made by the conservative
faction within the Party. Fundamentally, we need to demonstrate that
entrusting the nation to us would lead to better development than
leaving it in the hands of the conservatives.</p>
<p>0: Protect Yourself!</p>
<p>1: Unite and maintain open communication to safeguard our spaces for
discussion as much as possible.</p>
<p>While it's still recommended to use chat apps like WeChat and QQ,
please employ coded language to bypass censorship.</p>
<ul>
<li>The desire to protest is likely stronger among residents within the
country compared to those overseas.<br />
</li>
<li>Not everyone can access social media platforms beyond the Great
Firewall.<br />
</li>
<li>Using coded language can also strengthen our sense of unity and
belonging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Identify and target specific errors committed by the conservative
faction within the Party, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating videos on independent media to critique these errors.<br />
</li>
<li>Increasing the visibility of these issues to spark discussion.<br />
</li>
<li>Organizing peaceful protests if the errors are significant.</li>
</ul>
<p>2: Stay alert to signals from the progressive faction within the
Party; their political power is a formidable force that we need to
leverage.</p>
<p>3: Minimize vulnerabilities: Stay within legal bounds, remain
moderate in approach, and distance ourselves from extremist
dissenters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strict behavioral standards should be applied to those participating
in protests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-protest">How to Protest</h3>
<p>The essence of protest is for the people to express their
dissatisfaction in a mild manner.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Traditional forms of protest such as marches and sit-ins are valid,
but new methods can also be employed, such as flooding the comment
sections of official government media with messages or using anonymous
accounts to highlight issues. Organizing "Constitution Reading Groups"
can be effective. Protests should be decentralized, with every protester
acting as a focal point.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For a successful protest, collaboration among intellectuals
(students, white-collar workers, those knowledgeable about political
movements), overseas individuals, and grassroots workers and farmers is
crucial.</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Intellectuals can pinpoint the issues, craft slogans, plan
activities, and (eventually) negotiate with the Party.<br />
</li>
<li>Overseas individuals can help consolidate and disseminate
information to intellectuals and take the blame if things go
south.<br />
</li>
<li>Grassroots workers and farmers can provide manpower and lend
legitimacy to the protests (since the Party claims to be a "Marxist"
party).</li>
</ul>
<p>The more people participate in a protest, the better, but demands
should be specific.</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid making excessive demands; the important thing is to
successfully initiate the first protest.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Having support from Western countries might be beneficial, but it
could also provide fodder for extreme nationalists and care must be
taken as Western countries might prefer to escalate situations rather
than resolve them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="possible-demands">Possible Demands</h3>
<p>It's entirely reasonable for citizens to make demands of their
government, but this form of communication is not smooth in West Korea,
which is detrimental to both sides. <strong>Even the conservative
faction within the Party might agree that allowing citizens to make some
demands could help stabilize the situation.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some actions of the conservative faction are illegal (such as forced
demolitions and invasions of privacy), and although the laws are set by
the Party's subordinates (the National People's Congress), utilizing the
power of law can at least highlight the contradictions between the
reformists and conservatives.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>During our tug-of-war with the leadership, different stages of
struggle require different demands. Some current high-demand issues
include:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Stabilizing housing prices<br />
</li>
<li>Boosting the economy, maintaining development, and solving
employment issues<br />
</li>
<li>Education reform (this demand is broad and should be specified
during protests)<br />
</li>
<li>Protecting the rights in homosexual marriages
<ul>
<li>Not necessarily recognizing homosexual marriage but inventing a new
term to protect the rights of same-sex couples after marriage<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Abolishing the "offsetting rest days" policy<br />
</li>
<li>Raising the minimum wage standard and improving the welfare
treatment of rural populations</li>
</ul>
<p>Making some non-politically charged demands can also be useful,
perhaps even more effective than the above, as it allows citizens to
gauge the bottom line of the leadership and strengthens this mode of
communication, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demanding the Football Association to improve
football!</strong> (Not joking; everyone knows the FA is performing
poorly, which is a window to reveal possible government incompetence.
This is the only organization we can safely protest against now.)</li>
<li>Stopping the display of IP addresses on social media</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some demands are obviously excessive in the modern era, such as:</p>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li>Restoring the presidential term limit<br />
</li>
<li>Demanding freedom of speech (not excessive in 2010, but now it
is)<br />
</li>
<li>Public disclosure of civil servants' assets (not excessive in 2010,
but now it is)<br />
</li>
<li>Lifting the ban on political parties<br />
</li>
<li>Democracy, universal suffrage for the president<br />
</li>
<li>Self-determination for Taiwan<br />
</li>
<li>Overthrowing the current regime<br />
</li>
<li>Inviting Western colonization</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="a-note-of-caution-about-the-accelerationists">A Note of Caution
About the Accelerationists</h3>
<p>Accelerationists hope Xi will reverse reforms faster, leading to a
"break to rebuild" scenario, but I believe this is illogical:</p>
<p>Even if Xi performs poorly, it's unlikely for West Korea to collapse,
and the West doesn't wish for West Korea's collapse. A centipede dies
but never falls down. A collapse of West Korea would lead to decades of
hardship for the West Korean, and overseas West Korean would also
suffer. Even if West Korea collapses, who would establish a better
government than the current one? The support for acceleration might stem
from despair over reforming West Korea. But in the 21st century, nothing
is truly hopeless.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you feel strong despair, consider reading more books by
reformists. (Or read this article again.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="read-more-world-history">Read More World History</h3>
<p>The problems West Korea faces are, frankly, not unique; many
countries around the world have encountered similar issues:</p>
<p>Conservatism, backwardness, poverty, oppression: North Korea</p>
<p>A country ruled by a group of elite families: Guatemala</p>
<p>A new regime exacerbating exploitation after overthrowing the old
one: Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone</p>
<p>Plurality voting: South Korea under Park Chung-hee</p>
<p>A progressive country taking a huge step backward: Iran</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>My advice is to read more world history and politics. Our level of
political and historical knowledge may not be as high as that of the
leadership, but only by enhancing our knowledge can we engage in
dialogue with them on equal footing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="a-few-words-about-ourselves">A Few Words About Ourselves</h3>
<p>We are not dissidents; We support Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Wen
Jiabao, Li Keqiang, and others.</p>
<p>We are liberals, and for West Korea, I do not seek to overthrow the
regime but to reform West Korea's political system, leading West Korea
towards true modernization and democratization. I believe that under a
modernized, democratized government, West Korea's economy can unleash
even greater vitality.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>Do not despair; we still have strength! Use wisdom to find people we
can unite with.</p>
<p>The more illegal actions our enemies commit, the more people will
join us.</p>
<p>Our enemies are not foolish; even if they seem not very
knowledgeable, their level of sophistication increases when they convene
with their think tanks.</p>
<p>Not many people wish to overthrow the current regime; most prefer
peace.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Appendix: Selected Articles from the Constitution</p>
<p>1.1:</p>

<p>1.48:</p>
<p>The state protects the rights and interests of women, upholding the
principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women.</p>
<p><br></p>

safeguard the security, honor, and interests of the motherland.</p>
