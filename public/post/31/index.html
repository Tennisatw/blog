<h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<p>My younger brother was tasked by his school to write a 3,000-word
reflection on "The Communist Manifesto," and he asked for my help.
Embarrassingly, I hadn't read the Manifesto myself, so I took this as an
opportunity to dive in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I read <a
target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.marxists.org/chinese/marx/01.htm">this</a>
version.</p>
<p><img src="1.jpg" /></p>
<p><a

<p><br></p>
<h3 id="significance">Significance</h3>
<p>First and foremost, "The Communist Manifesto" played a pivotal role
in organizing labor struggles. It defined the proletariat, organized
unions, united workers, and led the proletariat in resisting capitalist
oppression, most importantly, making capitalist countries reconsider
their need to demonstrate their superiority. As Che Guevara once said,
"After we're gone, they'll build schools and hospitals for you, raise
your wages, not because they've had a change of heart or become kind,
but because we were here."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The struggle of the lower and middle classes is an eternal theme of
human civilization, as they often represent the most oppressed and
impoverished within a nation or society. Every left-leaning individual
(or rather, anyone who isn't far-right) should spend time and effort
contemplating how to mobilize these groups into a political force, unite
them, and improve their living conditions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p><strong>"The Communist Manifesto" is somewhat outdated in certain
aspects; the era of proletarian oppression it concerns is nearly behind
us.</strong> A clear example is the near absence of a true proletariat
in developed countries, where it has merged with the middle class.
Thanks to increased welfare, higher base wages, and various labor
movements, the proletariat in developed nations is no longer
"property-less" as before. Instead, they live relatively comfortable
lives.</p>
<p>For instance, in Canada, a worker earning a monthly salary of
<code>$ 5,000</code> can afford a <code>$ 400,000</code> small villa
(perhaps with some loans), drive a <code>$ 30,000</code> car, dine at
Earls for a decent <code>$ 40</code> steak, bread, and wine meal, and
buy groceries like 4L of milk for <code>$ 6</code>, 1kg of pork for
<code>$ 15</code>. Healthcare and eyeglasses are free, and education is
almost free. They enjoy weekends with sports, picnics, hiking, skiing,
and worship, and might even invest in stocks and bonds. This group can
be considered middle class.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Socialist states practicing Marxism-Leninism have generally
failed at checks and balances,</strong> leading to highly centralized
power. China, Vietnam, Laos, and Cuba are all authoritarian states,
ranking low on global democracy indices.</p>
<p>I believe this is fundamentally because Marxism doesn't prioritize
power balance, and its method of distributing state power is flawed. The
bourgeoisie have no standing in Marxist regimes, the right-wing has no
voice, and the proletariat lacks the education and oversight abilities.
This opens doors for those in actual power (the bureaucratic class
claiming to be proletarians) to consolidate their authority.</p>
<p>Moreover, "The Communist Manifesto" emphasizes the state power of the
proletarian dictatorship but downplays the supervision of the
"representatives of the proletariat." In reality, power corrupts all who
wield it. A leader from a proletarian background ceases to be a
proletarian the moment he assumes office; he becomes part of the
bureaucratic class. For various reasons, states capable of authoritarian
rule will inevitably resort to it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>"The Communist Manifesto" holds an overly extreme view on
traditional culture and religion.</strong> Modern society should value
diversity and individual rights more. For instance, if the goal of an
ideology is to eliminate all religions, then it inherently lacks
freedom. Furthermore, for a nation, is the benefit of "eliminating
religion" worth the effort compared to its costs?</p>
<p>I think the idea of eradicating traditional culture and religion
(among many similar notions) is essentially arrogant: "I believe this is
harmful to you, so I will eliminate it regardless of your
preference."</p>
<p>From a scientific standpoint, eradicating traditional culture and
religion might seem beneficial. However, humans and societies are
complex, and these elements offer alternative perspectives. Eliminating
them also eradicates social complexity, leading to homogenization.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In summary, political groups should critically study "The Communist
Manifesto," acknowledging its significance while being wary of its
"toxicity."</p>
<p>It represents an ideology that has never succeeded (no
Marxist-Leninist state has become developed, let alone a communist one),
shows apparent instability (lacking balance among political forces,
leaving many unrepresented), and most Marxist regimes ultimately
collapse or reform.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction is infinitely easier than construction. "The
Communist Manifesto" should only serve as a reference for left-wing
party activities, not as a guiding philosophy for a nation.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>For Chinese students, since Marxism is considered far-left (i.e., its
demands are too extreme compared to today's society: abolishing private
property, abolishing the state, pursuing excessive equality), it might
push students' thinking towards extremism. Therefore, Marxism is not
suitable as the first (or only) political theory lesson for students. A
course like "Introduction to Contemporary Chinese and World Political
Thought" would be better than "Principles of Marxism."</p>
<p><strong>Before committing to revolution attracted by the far-left's
utopian visions, young people should ponder whether a terrestrial
paradise is realistic.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I dislike Marx's statement, "Philosophers have only interpreted the
world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."</p>
<p>Marx and Engels were theorists who didn't perfect their theory yet
dismissed its importance. Isn't this ostrich mentality?</p>
<p>Moreover, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, driven
by Mao Zedong and others' rigid adherence to communist literature and
inflexible theories, brought suffering to China. Concepts like "Man must
conquer nature," "exercise subjective initiative," and "class struggle"
were to blame.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No stable modern state is built on hatred, seeking "revenge" against
another class (e.g., the feudal or capitalist classes). All hatred can
be a tool for rulers to manipulate and control the masses.</p>
<p>Moreover, if the feudal and capitalist classes are eliminated, what
is the government's legitimacy? Shouldn't the government step down and
relinquish power?</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="analysis-of-selected-sentences">Analysis of Selected
Sentences</h3>
<p>Below is my aggressive analysis, sentence by sentence, of some
passages from "The Communist Manifesto."</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="chapter-one-bourgeois-and-proletarians">Chapter One: Bourgeois
and Proletarians</h4>
<p>"All hitherto societies have had a history of class struggles."</p>
<p>I think a more accurate description would be, "The history of all
societies up to now has been the history of various forces in
balance."</p>
<p>People do not necessarily need to ally with others of the same class.
There are struggles within the bourgeoisie, such as corporate warfare.
Even among "proletarians," there are conflicts. Moreover, in an atomized
society, every individual is in competition with everyone around them,
rendering class irrelevant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the term "struggle" may not be the most fitting. In a
well-functioning society, the competition among various forces is not so
intense, and there are many historical examples of successful peaceful
protests. Instead of "struggle," "balance" might be a more appropriate
term.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto
honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the
physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into
its paid wage laborers."</p>
<p>And then what?</p>
<p>If not compensated with money for their labor, should we use
something more ethereal? It's not impossible, but it could facilitate
exploitation by the powerful over the weak. For example, a village
tyrant or local official could have his doctor treat him for free,
without any compensation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The bourgeoisie, during its rule of less than a hundred years, has
created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all
preceding generations together."</p>
<p>I'd argue that it's "advanced technology," not the "bourgeoisie,"
that created productive forces. The proletariat, or even emperors, could
also utilize advanced technology to create productive forces, build
steamships, and lay telegraph lines.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal
master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of
laborers, crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers."</p>
<p>Personally, I'm not sure whether small workshops or large factories
are definitively more comfortable for workers. However, with the
advancement of time, large factories are more advanced, brighter,
cleaner, and have stricter safety measures, possibly making them
somewhat better than small workshops.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Occasionally the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The
real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in
the ever-expanding union of the workers."</p>
<p>I strongly agree. If workers are to gain more power, they must unite
to fight atomization by the state or capitalists.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its
birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is
carried on by individual laborers, then by the workpeople of a factory,
then by the operatives of one trade, in one locality, against the
individual bourgeois who directly exploits them."</p>
<p>I strongly agree. The workers' failures are temporary. As long as
they continue to be oppressed, they will organize and resist. I
sincerely hope that everyone dissatisfied with their lives will take the
time to read "The Communist Manifesto."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"In the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large
are already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property; his
relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with
the bourgeois family relations."</p>
<p>Is this how it should be or how it actually is? I don't believe the
proletariat should or indeed has abandoned nation, law, morality, or
religion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="chapter-two-proletarians-and-communists">Chapter Two:
Proletarians and Communists</h4>
<p>"The average price of wage labor is the minimum wage, i.e., that
quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to
keep the laborer in bare existence as a laborer."</p>
<p>This only holds true in situations where workers cannot unite to
demand their rights. In modern society, workers' wages are determined by
the degree of their unity and the scarcity of labor.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Some object that upon the abolition of private property, all work
will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us."</p>
<p>The latter half of this statement does not logically follow from the
first. It can be argued that in bourgeois society, workers not
benefiting from their labor is relative, as workers still possess some
private property. It's precisely because private property exists that a
diligent ethos is maintained. And we know that the communal dining hall
model, which fully realizes communism, indeed breeds laziness.</p>
<p>We can infer from this that "The Communist Manifesto" is not a bible,
its contents are not eternal truths, and its authors are not saints.
There are errors within that need to be corrected by later
generations.</p>

<p>"But you communists would introduce community of women, screams the
entire bourgeoisie in chorus. The bourgeois sees his wife merely as a
production instrument.<br />
When they hear that production instruments are to be exploited in
common, they naturally think that the same fate will befall women.<br />
They fail to consider that the issue lies in stopping women from being
treated merely as instruments of production. In fact, it's ludicrous for
the bourgeoisie, with their sanctimonious appearances, to express shock
at the so-called official community of women proposed by communists. The
community of women has almost always existed; it doesn't need to be
introduced by communists.<br />
Our bourgeois, not satisfied with having the wives and daughters of
their proletarians at their disposal, not to mention the formal
institution of prostitution, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each
other's wives.<br />
Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a form of 'wives in common.' People
can at most accuse communists of wanting to introduce an officially
sanctioned, openly acknowledged form of 'wives in common' in place of
one that is hypocritically concealed."</p>
<p>Firstly, it's unclear whether Marx and Engels support "community of
women." They seem to tacitly permit communists to practice it while also
indicating the public's aversion to it and suggesting the bourgeoisie's
misconduct in this regard is illegitimate. If Marx intended to use the
bourgeoisie's "community of women" and traditional culture's version to
justify the proletariat's version, it contradicts the logic of "The
Manifesto" itself (since it previously invalidated the legitimacy of the
bourgeoisie and traditional culture).</p>
<p>Secondly, even in 2023, there are hardly any proponents of "community
of women." No communist country has legalized it, let alone in the era
when "The Manifesto" was written. Although we might reluctantly say "The
Communist Manifesto" is a very futuristic and advanced declaration, if
it still seems ahead of its time nearly 200 years later, it's hard to
say whether it's a prophecy or a fantasy.</p>
<p>Thirdly, how can we prove statements like "The bourgeoisie sees his
wife as a mere instrument of production" and "Bourgeois marriage is, in
reality, a system of wives in common"? Regarding bourgeois marriage, I
have no experience or insight, but I believe the vast majority of people
do not consider bourgeois marriage to be a form of communal marriage.
Marx and Engels likely made the mistake of using a minority to represent
the whole, taking the most morally bankrupt among the bourgeoisie as
representative of all. Even if these statements were true, does someone
else's wrongdoing justify the proletariat's? Is the misdeed of others a
reason for one not to do good?</p>
<p>Lastly, Marx and Engels launch broad accusations without evidence,
acting like online trolls ("The bourgeois not satisfied with having the
wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal, not to
speak of common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each
other's wives."). I acknowledge there must be members of the bourgeoisie
who have engaged in such behavior, but what matters is the overall
quality. If there's even one bourgeois who does not engage in
prostitution, doesn't the logic of this statement collapse?</p>
<p>However, it must be said, it's filled with a fighting spirit, akin to
a shrewish quarrel or internet trolls launching attacks everywhere. It's
drawing targets out of thin air, concluding first and discrediting for
the sake of discrediting. Such lofty discourse is truly refined.</p>

<p>"Some accuse communists of wanting to abolish nations and
nationalities."<br />
"Workers have no country. You cannot take from them what they do not
have."</p>
<p>According to Marx, if workers feel they have no country, then they
indeed have none. Even if they believe they do, it's irrelevant. This is
quite an authoritarian stance.</p>
<p>A compromise would be to send all workers who feel they have no
country to a "Marxist state," while those who feel a connection to their
homeland can return to their respective nations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling
class."</p>
<p>Strongly agree, this is insightful.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Provide public and free education for all children, abolish the
current form of child labor in factories, and integrate education with
material production, among other measures.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the "Up to the Mountains and Down to the
Countryside" movement, where children were mobilized for production
labor. Reflecting on it, Mao Zedong's adherence to "The Communist
Manifesto" seems proficient... whether this was a blessing or a curse is
still up for debate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4 id="chapter-three-socialist-and-communist-literature">Chapter Three:
Socialist and Communist Literature</h4>
<p>"To win over the people, nobles brandish the proletarian's beggar's
bag as a flag. However, whenever the people follow them, they discover
the old feudal coat of arms on their backsides, leading to laughter and
dispersion. "</p>
<p>Is this reality or Marx's fantasy? If it's the latter, data is needed
to show how many nobles attempted to win over the people and how many
people saw through their "tricks."</p>
<p>My assessment is: Inferior propaganda, appealing to emotions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h4
id="chapter-four-position-of-the-communists-in-relation-to-the-various-existing-opposition-parties">Chapter
Four: Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing
Opposition Parties</h4>
<p>"In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary
movement against the existing social and political order of
things."<br />
"The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly
declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow
of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a
Communistic revolution."</p>
<p>How does this differ from terrorism, such as the jihadist faction of
Islam? Moreover, communism seems less suited to human society than
Islamic doctrine (since there are no pure communist states today, but
there are pure Islamic states).</p>
<p>Could the jihadist faction also say: "We jihadists support every
revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order,
let Europe tremble before the glory of the true God."</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>"Workers of the world, unite!"</p>
<p>"Burrito lovers of the world, unite!"</p>
<p>"Burrito lovers" is a term I've coined for those who enjoy burritos
and have eaten them in at least two out of their last three meals. I
believe "burrito lovers" have more in common worldwide and more shared
demands than "proletarians." The term itself is better defined, and
"burrito lovers" should be able to unite more easily than
"proletarians."</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h3>
<p>My younger brother plans to revise this reflection before submitting
it. I believe it might be the most aggressive critique of "The Communist
Manifesto" his school has received in the past three years.</p>
