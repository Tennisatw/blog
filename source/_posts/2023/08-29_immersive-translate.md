推荐这个翻译插件/软件：[沉浸式翻译](https://immersivetranslate.com/)

I highly recommend this translation tool: [Immersive Translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/).

<p class="tennisbot" id="其实这也是Tennisatw使用中英双语写博客的原因">它比一般的翻译软件好的一点是，它可以同时显示原文和译文。当时间充足时，可以读原文，并读一遍译文检查自己的理解是否正确。时间不足时也可以只读译文。如果怀疑译文翻译得有问题，也可以在原文中寻找对照。用这种方法阅读可以大大提高外语水平。</p>

<p class="tennisbot" id="In fact, this is also the reason why Tennisatw blogs in both Chinese and English.">What sets it apart from other translation tools is its ability to display both the original text and the translation side by side. This allows you to read the original text and then cross-reference it with the translation, enhancing your understanding and foreign language proficiency. Even when time is tight, you can simply read the translations. If you're dubious about a translation, you can easily refer back to the original text. </p>

免费，且不需实名，我用起来相当满意。

It's free and doesn't require real-name registration, and it's very satisfactory to use.
