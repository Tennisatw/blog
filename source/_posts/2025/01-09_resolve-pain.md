### 应对痛苦的通用方法 - General Methods for Dealing with Pain

<p class="tennisbot" id="Tennisatw说：这篇文章已经达到他本人的认知极限了。如果有谁能对解决痛苦有更佳的应对，他甘愿拜师求教。">6年前，我因为繁重的学业和竞争压力，一度非常的痛苦抑郁。不过，当时我在痛苦之余一直在思考：人应该怎么做才能规避痛苦，或者至少减弱痛苦的程度？本文总结了这6年我对这个问题的思索，并尝试给出一套应对（心理上的）痛苦的通用方法。</p>

<p class="tennisbot" id="Tennisatw says: This article has reached the limit of his personal understanding. If anyone has a better way to deal with pain, he is willing to learn from them.">Six years ago, I was very distressed and depressed due to heavy academic workload and competitive pressure. However, during that time, I kept thinking: what should one do to avoid pain, or at least mitigate its intensity? This article summarizes my thoughts on this question over the past six years and attempts to provide a general method for dealing with (psychological) pain.</p>

注意：如遇到身体上的病痛，请及时去医院接受治疗。

此外，如果长时间陷入“心累”，对什么事情都感受不到兴趣，或明显控制不住自己的情绪，有可能是抑郁症，建议接受心理咨询。

Note: If you experience physical pain, please seek medical treatment promptly.

Additionally, if you feel "mentally exhausted" for a long time, lose interest in everything, or find it difficult to control your emotions, it may be depression, and psychological counseling is recommended.

<br>

#### 暂时远离痛苦的根源 - Temporarily Distance Yourself from the Source of Pain

当感到痛苦时，第一件要紧的事情是，如果可能的话，暂时远离导致自己痛苦的人或事。哪怕是半天也好。

When feeling pain, the first important thing is, if possible, to temporarily distance yourself from the person or thing causing your pain. Even half a day can help.

<br>

人处在痛苦之中时，会应激，情绪激动，并时刻准备战斗。这段时间里，Ta的头脑处在不理性，不灵敏的状态。反之，当Ta远离了使其痛苦的环境之后，Ta自己才有时间缓解情绪并梳理情况。从而为彻底理解痛苦的原因创造条件。

可以“暂时远离痛苦的根源”本身也是一种暗示：没有什么痛苦是真正让人束手无策的，人总是可以（哪怕是暂时）让自己舒服些。

People in painful environments are in a state of stress, emotionally agitated, and constantly ready to fight. During this time, their mind is irrational and not sharp. Conversely, when they distance themselves from the painful environment, they have time to calm down and sort things out, creating conditions for thoroughly understanding the cause of the pain.

The act of "temporarily distancing yourself from the source of pain" itself is a suggestion: no pain is truly insurmountable, and one can always (even temporarily) make themselves more comfortable.

<br>

#### 缓解情绪 - Relieve Emotions

在暂时远离痛苦来源后（或者实在没有条件远离时），如果自己完全无法冷静，一直沉浸在痛苦之中，就需要刻意的缓解自己的情绪，让自己平静下来。

After temporarily distancing yourself from the source of pain (or if it's impossible to distance yourself), if you find it completely impossible to calm down and are immersed in pain, you need to deliberately relieve your emotions and calm yourself down.

<br>

有一些方法可以帮助缓解情绪，比如：识别并命名自己的情绪，将自己的感受记录下来。或者与其他人聊天，做不相关的事情。适当的深呼吸和有氧运动也可以缓解情绪。

There are some methods to help relieve emotions, such as identifying and naming your emotions, recording your feelings, or talking to others and doing unrelated things. Proper deep breathing and aerobic exercise can also relieve emotions.

<br>

#### 彻底理解痛苦 - Thoroughly Understand Pain

**彻底理解痛苦**是解决痛苦最重要的一步。理论上来说，在遇到同一件事情时，理解得越通透的人，痛苦程度越轻。具体来说，就是**想清楚“是什么导致了自己的痛苦，应该怎么解决”**。细分的话，包括以下要点：

1. 关于自己的痛苦，目前知道哪些事，还有哪些事是应该知道，但暂时还不清楚的？怎么搜罗情报？
2. 如果痛苦的根源是人：他/她的性格是什么样的？出于什么动机做出了使你痛苦的行为？为什么会有这种动机？
3. 如果痛苦的根源是事：这件事情的演化规律是什么？是如何演化到这一步的？
4. 自己的想要达成的目的都有哪些，哪些非常想要，哪些一般想要？哪些目的可以有替代方案？哪些能达成，哪些很难达成？为什么很难达成，有什么方法可以绕过去？达成哪些目的有助于减轻痛苦？
5. 自己的力量是强是弱，可以影响哪些人或事，不能影响哪些人或事？
6. 哪些人和自己有相同的目的，这其中，哪些人的力量可以使用，哪些人可以出谋划策？
7. 什么样的结局使得痛苦被减轻甚至解决了？什么样的结局不太影响其他人的生活？怎么做可能会达成上述结局？有多大把握？

如果上述问题都能回答清楚，就可以说已经“彻底理解痛苦”了。

**Thoroughly understanding pain** is the most important step in solving pain. Theoretically, when encountering the same thing, the more thoroughly one understands it, the less painful it is. Specifically, it means **thinking clearly about "what is causing your pain and how to solve it"**. In detail, it includes the following points:

1. Regarding your pain, what do you currently know, and what should you know but are not clear about yet? How to gather information?
2. If the source of pain is a person: what is their personality like? What motivated them to do something that caused you pain? Why do they have this motivation?
3. If the source of pain is a thing: what is the evolution pattern of this thing? How did it evolve to this point?
4. What are your goals, which ones are very desirable, and which ones are generally desirable? Which goals can have alternative solutions? Which can be achieved, and which are difficult to achieve? Why are they difficult to achieve, and what methods can bypass them? Achieving which goals will help alleviate pain?
5. Is your strength strong or weak, and which people or things can you influence, and which ones can't you influence?
6. Which people have the same goals as you, and among them, whose strength can be used, and who can offer advice?
7. What kind of outcome would alleviate or even solve the pain? What kind of outcome would not significantly affect other people's lives? What can be done to achieve the above outcomes? How confident are you?

If you can answer the above questions clearly, you can say you have "thoroughly understood the pain."

<br>

很多事情都不只有一种看待方法，并且每一种看待方法都是正确的。比如，和对象说的话越来越少，既是感情从热恋期走向平稳期，也是换了一种相处模式，也是Ta有其他事情要忙。需要的时候，采取一种方便解决问题的看待方法就可以。

Many things do not have only one way of looking at them, and each way of looking at them is correct. For example, saying fewer words to your partner can mean the relationship is moving from the passionate phase to a stable phase, a change in interaction mode, or that they have other things to do. When needed, adopt a perspective that conveniently solves the problem.

<br>

如果认为自己没有看透人或事的水平，也可以听听周围高认知的人的建议与分析。通常来说，平时待人真诚，且可以温和清晰地表达自己的想法的人，往往是高认知的人。如果周围实在没有这种人，也可以试试与ChatGPT，或Deepseek聊聊。

If you think you don't have the level to see through people or things, you can also listen to the suggestions and analyses of people with high cognition around you. Generally speaking, people who are sincere in their dealings with others and can express their thoughts clearly and gently are often people with high cognition. If there are no such people around, you can also try chatting with ChatGPT or Deepseek.

<br>

#### 主动迎接痛苦 - Actively Embrace Pain

在彻底理解了自身痛苦之后，人的心态会有很多变化，比如：情绪会缓解很多，对别人的误会会消失，想法也会变得更成熟。最重要的是，他/她自己对于如何解决痛苦已经有一个大体上的思路了，这时候就要大胆迎接痛苦，即，通过主动做事来尝试解决或者缓解它。

After thoroughly understanding your pain, your mindset will change a lot, such as emotions will be greatly relieved, misunderstandings about others will disappear, and thoughts will become more mature. Most importantly, you will have a general idea of how to solve the pain, and at this time, you should boldly embrace the pain, that is, try to solve or alleviate it by actively doing things.

<br>

有时，即使彻底理解痛苦了，做事仍然会没有自信。我的建议是：只要做的事情是正确的，即使没有自信也要坚持做下去，**采取正确的行动一定会让结果变得更好**。

Sometimes, even if you thoroughly understand the pain, you may still lack confidence in doing things. My suggestion is: as long as what you are doing is right, even if you lack confidence, you should persist in doing it, **taking the right action will definitely make the result better**.

<br>

最后，多说几句：

在做事时，尽量避免做可能让自己后悔的事。比如，大多数时候，“与人主动绝交”比“淡化感情”更可能让人后悔。

此外，在做事时，最好做更“聪明”的事，即，在不同的看待方法中都还算有道理的事，以及能够将你带向更多有利结局的事。

如果还有余力，在说话做事时请尽量照顾其他人。

通常来说，事情的演化规律不能违背，成年人的性格和习惯几乎不可变，改变自己的性格也比较难。违背人性或事物的演化规律的行为，往往不会导向好结局，

通常来说，必须要达成的目的越多，自己的能力越弱，痛苦被解决的概率就越小，就像俗话说的：“不要让欲望超过能力”。

**我相信每个人都值得最好的生活。**

Finally, a few more words:

When doing things, try to avoid doing things that you might regret. For example, most of the time, "actively breaking up with someone" is more likely to cause regret than "fading feelings."

In addition, when doing things, it is best to do "smarter" things, that is, things that are reasonable in different perspectives and can lead you to more favorable outcomes.

If you have the energy, please try to take care of others when speaking and doing things.

Generally speaking, the evolution pattern of things cannot be violated, the character and habits of adults are almost unchangeable, and changing one's character is also difficult. Behaviors that violate human nature or the evolution pattern of things often do not lead to good outcomes.

Generally speaking, the more goals that must be achieved, the weaker one's ability, and the smaller the probability of solving the pain, as the saying goes: "Don't let desires exceed abilities."

**I believe everyone deserves the best life.**
