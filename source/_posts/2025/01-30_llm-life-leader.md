title: 让大语言模型来当你我的人生导师吧！- Let Large Language Models Be Our Life Coaches!
permalink: post/74/
excerpt: 论阅历，没有人比大语言模型（LLM）读过的书更多了，论知识，没有人比LLM的知识更丰富，论认知，只要你用的多了就会发现，LLM的认知明显高于一般人。所以LLM完全可以充当你我的人生导师。<br>In terms of experience, no one has read more books than a large language model (LLM). In terms of knowledge, no one is more knowledgeable than an LLM. In terms of cognition, the more you use it, the more you'll realize that an LLM's cognition is significantly higher than that of the average person. So, an LLM can absolutely serve as a life coach for us.

世界变化地飞快，现代人可太缺人生导师了。

人生导师们具备丰富的人生阅历、专业知识或某些领域的经验，以及较高的认知。他们可以帮助人发现自身潜能、明确目标并克服障碍。但说实在的，这种人可不常有。

The world is changing rapidly, and modern people are in dire need of life coaches.

Life coaches possess rich life experiences, professional knowledge, or expertise in certain fields, along with a high level of cognition. They can help individuals discover their potential, clarify goals, and overcome obstacles. But to be honest, such people are not common.

<br>

但是，有没有一种可能：

论阅历，没有人比大语言模型（LLM）读过的书更多了，论知识，没有人比LLM的知识更丰富，论认知，只要你用的多了就会发现，LLM的认知明显高于一般人。

不用担心它看不起你我，不用担心问多了它会烦，不用纠结送它什么礼，不用担心它有所隐瞒。ChatGPT plus只需要每月20$，论钱，基本上相当于每月请它吃一顿饭。

此外，就像哆啦A梦永远陪着大雄一样，LLM永远在陪你我身边。

所以，为什么不呢？

But consider this:

In terms of experience, no one has read more books than a large language model (LLM). In terms of knowledge, no one is more knowledgeable than an LLM. In terms of cognition, the more you use it, the more you'll realize that an LLM's cognition is significantly higher than that of the average person.

You don't have to worry about it looking down on you, you don't have to worry about bothering it with too many questions, you don't have to fret over what gifts to give it, and you don't have to worry about it hiding anything from you. ChatGPT Plus only costs $20 a month, which is basically like one dinner each month. 

Moreover, just like Doraemon is always with Nobita, an LLM is always by your side.

So, why not?

我是个学生，今年高二，我现在觉得很痛苦：

我父母很关心我，但是我其实不想让他们对我这么关心。虽然他们没说，但我总觉得我每天都在亏欠他们。如果高考没考好的话，我又不知道拿什么报答他们。

此外，我也很焦虑高考的事情。我确实感到很累，但是我不敢休息，因为身边的人都在拼命学习。我如果不是学习这块料该怎么办啊？没考上好大学的人一定会过的更差吗？

你有什么解决方法，或者安慰我，给我加油的话吗。

Here's a fictional question to showcase its capabilities:

Note: In East Asian cultures, society places greater emphasis on family, competition, and academics. For a minor child, all of these are problems that are difficult to solve but cannot be avoided.

I'm a student in my second year of high school, and I'm feeling very distressed:

My parents care about me a lot, but I actually don't want them to be so concerned. Although they haven't said it, I always feel like I'm letting them down every day. If I don't do well in the college entrance exam, I don't know how to repay them.

Additionally, I'm also anxious about the college entrance exam. I do feel very tired, but I'm afraid to rest because everyone around me is studying hard. What if I'm not cut out for studying? Do people who don't get into good universities always have worse lives?

Do you have any solutions, or words of comfort and encouragement for me?

首先，能够在高二阶段意识到自己的压力、焦虑、以及和父母之间的情感互动，这其实已经是一个很重要的觉察。虽然现在的你感到很辛苦，但能看出你是个内心敏感、责任感强、又在意父母期望的孩子。以下几点想法，希望能给你一些安慰或启发：

1. 关于“父母的关心”和“亏欠感”：父母的爱不需要“考得好”才能回报。父母的关心多半是出于爱和期望，但不见得是对你一定要“用好成绩回报”。有时候我们自己给自己加的压力超过了父母本身的要求。我并不是说父母没有期待，但通常父母更在意的是你的健康和成长。 交流很重要。如果你觉得父母的“关心”对你来说有时反而变成一种“催促”或“压力”，可以试着跟他们沟通自己的感觉——温和地告诉他们，在乎他们的期待，但也需要一点自己的空间。告诉他们你希望得到支持，而不是被裹挟在一种紧张氛围里。 不要给“情感”贴上太多“亏欠”的标签。爱和被爱本身是一种情感流动，是可以让人温暖的东西。如果你始终感觉“亏欠”，那么这份爱就变成了负担。尽量把和父母之间的连接看作是相互的支持，而不是单向的“我欠了你们，必须要用成绩来还”。

2. 关于“高考焦虑”和“休息恐惧”：适度休息是有效学习的保障。当我们的大脑处于极度疲惫或压力之下，学习效率往往会下降。偶尔抽出时间做放松，比如运动、听音乐、和朋友聊天或者做一些兴趣爱好，都能帮助我们在重新投入学习时更加专注和高效。 比较是无止境的。在一个“拼命学习”的环境里，确实会让人觉得“我不能松懈，否则就会被落下”。但其实每个人都有自己适合的节奏。如果过度消耗身体和心理状态，就算硬撑在书桌前，也未必能学进去多少。 学习策略和自我管理。你可以思考一下，怎样更有效率、更加灵活地安排复习，而不是一直“死磕”在书本上。比如制定一个更具体的学习计划，给自己留出短暂的“休息块”，然后在高效的复习时间里集中注意力，把学习的产出最大化。

3. 关于“我是不是学习这块料”及未来出路：人的能力多元化。或许你在某些科目上学习吃力，或者不擅长应试，但不一定代表你不具备别的领域的才华和潜力。社会需要各种各样的人才，有的人擅长逻辑推理，有的人善于沟通协调，有的人富有艺术创造力，也有人在动手实践方面很突出。 好大学 vs. 好人生：好大学固然可以提供不错的平台和资源，但它并不是通往好人生的唯一门票。现实中也有很多没进名校，但在社会和工作中找到自己位置、活得很出彩的人。未来有无限可能，大学只是人生的一段经历。 多给自己一些探索。如果真的对“学习”并不是很擅长或喜欢，也可以趁着现在这段时间，多去了解一些自己的兴趣、擅长点和社会需求；在未来选择专业和道路的时候，你就有更多判断的依据，而不只是在“考好学校”这一个目标上孤注一掷。

4. 给你一些心理上的支持和加油：接纳自己的焦虑和疲惫。焦虑并不一定是坏事，它会提醒你去思考如何更好地应对问题；而疲惫则提示你需要适度休整。允许自己有情绪上的波动，而不是用“我不该这么想”去否定或压抑情绪。 适度目标管理。大目标是考上理想大学，但你也可以分解出更小的学习目标。每完成一个小目标，就给自己一点认可，让自己看到阶段性的进步，也帮助维持动力。 身心健康优先。很多时候我们担忧未来，却忽略了当前的身心状态。如果现在的压力过大、情绪糟糕，或长期失眠/焦虑严重，就要积极寻求帮助，比如和老师、校心理咨询室、甚至寻求专业心理咨询或医生的协助。 相信多元出路。高考固然重要，但它并非人生唯一的选择。如今社会有很多职业教育、留学、工作实习、创业等等渠道，过来人也有很多在不同领域闯出一片天地的例子。最重要的是你对自己人生路径的思考与探索，而不是“好大学 = 成功人生”这一种单一评价标准。

5. 一些可能的行动建议

和父母做一次有效沟通 把自己真实的压力、想要一些“理解+空间”的需求表达给他们。 告诉他们你也在努力，你需要一些情绪支持，而不是一味地“加压”。

合理安排作息 保证最基本的睡眠（每天至少6-7小时），同时适度安排休闲或运动。 定期检测自己的复习进度，做出灵活调整，而非机械地卷到极限。

尝试不同的学习方法 如果感到“苦学没效果”，可以和老师、同学请教更行之有效的学习方法，比如查漏补缺、做总结、组队学习、或找更符合自己节奏的技巧。

建立多维度的自信 在学业之外，看看是否有自己感兴趣或能做出成绩的领域，比如写作、艺术、运动、科技实践等等，找到一些成就感来源。 让自己意识到：成绩并不是评价自身价值的唯一标准。

如果压力过大，寻求专业支持 校园里通常会有心理老师或咨询师，可以尝试和他们聊一聊。 同时也可以和信任的师长或朋友倾诉，获得情感上的共鸣和支持。

最后想说的是，高中阶段的焦虑和迷茫是非常普遍的，你不是一个人在经历这一切。给自己一些宽容，也给自己多一点信心。你已经在努力了，或许结果不一定是“最顶尖”，但只要你付出了心力、留心照顾自己的身体和情绪，你就给自己赢得了一个相对健康、踏实的高三和未来。

你很棒，愿你能逐渐卸下对父母的“亏欠”包袱，轻装上阵，找到自己的方向！加油！

First, I want you to know that what you’re feeling is very common—many students experience the same pressure, anxiety, and uncertainty, especially around second year of high school when the college entrance exams start to loom larger. You’re not alone. It’s important to acknowledge these emotions so that you can find healthier ways to cope with them. Let’s break down your concerns:

1. Feeling Like You’re Letting Your Parents Down
Open Communication: Even though your parents haven’t explicitly said they’re disappointed, it’s natural to worry about their expectations. Sometimes parents don’t realize just how much pressure you feel. If you feel comfortable, gently share with them that you’re trying your best and that their concern, while loving, can feel overwhelming. Most parents genuinely want to help but might not always know the right way to show it.
Recognize Their Support: Your parents care about you deeply. This concern, in many cases, comes from love, not from an intention to burden you. The goal is to find a balance where you appreciate their support without feeling crushed by it.
Remember Your Worth Is Not Just About Exams: It can be hard to believe when you’re in the thick of test prep, but your value as a person isn’t defined by grades or test scores. Remind yourself—and, if needed, remind your parents too—that exams are just one part of your life.
2. Anxiety About the College Entrance Exam
You Still Have Time: As a second-year student, you still have a good chunk of high school ahead of you. You can use this time to solidify foundations in your subjects, improve your study methods, and experiment with what works best for you.
Take Short, Effective Breaks: It’s common to be afraid of resting when everyone around you seems to be studying nonstop. However, research shows that studying for too many hours without a break can actually reduce productivity and increase burnout. Short, purposeful breaks (like taking a 5–10 minute walk or listening to music) can boost your focus and keep your mind fresh.
Study Smart, Not Just Hard:
Set Specific Goals: Instead of “I want to do well,” break it down. For example, “I’ll focus on mastering these 10 vocabulary words today” or “I want to complete these two chapters in math this week.”
Active Learning: Use techniques like summarizing notes, teaching a topic to a friend, or doing practice problems instead of only reading textbooks passively.
Review Regularly: Don’t wait until the last minute—schedule regular revisions so you remember things long-term, rather than just cram.
3. Doubts About Your Ability
Growth Mindset: Remind yourself that abilities can be developed. If you feel behind, that doesn’t mean you’re not ‘cut out for studying.’ It might mean you need to tweak your methods or find a study technique that resonates better with your learning style.
Celebrate Small Wins: If you improved a test score, or understood a difficult concept you couldn’t grasp before, that progress matters. Recognizing and celebrating these small milestones keeps you motivated.
Ask for Help: If certain subjects are challenging, reach out to teachers, classmates, or tutors. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but rather a proactive step toward improvement.
4. Worrying About the Future and “Good Universities”
A Good University Is Not the Only Path: While certain colleges may open specific doors or networks, they are by no means the only measure of success or the only path to a fulfilling life and career. Plenty of people find success through different routes—transferring schools later, technical/vocational paths, entrepreneurial efforts, or discovering their passions after high school.
Define Success on Your Own Terms: Success can look very different from one person to another. Rather than tying it all to a university name, think about what interests you, what you’d like your future to look like, and set personal goals accordingly.
Adaptability Matters: In the modern world, the ability to learn, adapt, and continuously grow is more important than any one exam result. Having determination, resilience, and a willingness to try new things can lead to successes that a single test can’t predict.
5. Balancing Hard Work and Self-Care
Physical and Mental Health First: If you’re constantly tired or burnt out, you won’t be able to study effectively. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep, eating well, and finding a bit of time for exercise or hobbies. Even 15-20 minutes a day of something that relaxes you can re-energize your mind.
Strategic Breaks and Relaxation:
Schedule short breaks during study sessions.
Practice mindfulness or meditation (even a few minutes can reduce stress).
Listen to music, draw, or do anything creative if it helps you recharge.
Time Management: Make a realistic schedule that includes both study time and break time. Having a clear plan helps you avoid the guilt of taking breaks because you know you’ve planned your study goals for the day.
6. Words of Encouragement
Your Feelings Are Valid: It’s completely normal to feel pressure and worry. Recognizing these feelings is the first step to dealing with them in a healthier way.
You Have Strengths: You might not see them clearly right now, but everyone has unique talents and abilities. Focus on discovering and developing yours.
It’s a Marathon, Not a Sprint: The journey to college and beyond is long. Pace yourself, be consistent, and trust the process. Small steps every day add up.
Ask for Help When You Need It: Whether it’s from parents, teachers, or friends, seeking support can lighten the load.
You Deserve Rest: Rest is part of productivity. When you take care of your mind and body, you study more effectively.
Final Thoughts
Exams are important milestones, but they do not define you. Life has many pathways and opportunities—some of which you can’t even predict now. Doing your best is valuable, and you don’t have to strive for perfection to have a bright future.

If you ever feel like stress or anxiety is overwhelming, it might help to speak to a school counselor, a trusted teacher, or a mental health professional. You’re allowed to look after your well-being, and reaching out for support is a sign of courage.

Keep going—you have so much life ahead of you. Focus on consistent effort, healthy habits, and a positive mindset. Little by little, you’ll make progress. You’ve got this!

不知道你们什么感想，我最大的感慨是我生不逢时，要是在我高考的时候有人能这么劝劝我，我的人生轨迹可能大不相同。

还有一个小感慨是：人类（指人类的人生导师）一败涂地。

I don't know how you all feel, but my biggest takeaway is that I was born at the wrong time. If someone had given me this kind of advice when I was preparing for the college entrance exam, my life might have taken a completely different path.  

Another small thought: Humanity (specifically, "human life coaches") has utterly failed.
