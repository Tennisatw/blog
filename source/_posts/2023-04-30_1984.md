假设我们生活在《1984》里的世界里。

Imagine living in the world of "1984".

<p><br></p>

我们每天过的日子很差，勉强吃饱穿暖，没有任何娱乐，也没有任何私人空间。我们的生老病死都由老大哥接管。我们就像工蜂和工蚁一样，没有自己的想法，人生唯一的事情就是为老大哥奉献。

Our daily lives are miserable, barely having enough to eat and wear, with no entertainment and no private space. The Big Brother takes control of everything. We are like worker bees and ants, devoid of our own thoughts, and our sole purpose in life is to serve the Big Brother.

<p><br></p>

在这种世界里，什么都不想的人最幸福。只要人一开始思考，问，为什么我们的世界是这个样子，他/她就马上会痛苦，因为他/她似乎本来是可能生活在一个更好的世界中的。很可能，这种人就丧失了生活的兴趣，变得消极，“郁郁不得志”。

In this world, those who don't think are the happiest. As soon as one starts to ponder and ask why our world is this way, he or she will immediately experience suffering because it seems that they could have lived in a better world. It's highly likely that these people would lose interest in life, becoming negative and feeling "thwarted and despondent."

我们生活的世界是有1984的成分的。喜欢的人当然认为“这多好啊，世界就应该是这个样子”。但是不喜欢的人却很绝望：讨厌它，却又没有能力拒绝。用一个不太恰当的比喻：就像是被强奸。

The world we live in is partly similar to the world discribe in "1984". Those who like it, naturally think, "This is so great; the world should be this way." However, those who dislike it feel desperate: they detest it yet lack the power to resist. To use a somewhat inappropriate analogy, it's like a person being assaulted.

<p><br></p>

回到正题，假如我们生活在1984，我们如何在那种世界中生活下去呢？或者说，我们如何做才能在1984的世界里过上尽可能好的生活呢？

Back to the main topic, if we were living in 1984, how would we survive in that world? Or rather, how can we live the best possible life in a world like 1984?

<p><br></p>

这个问题对于现实主义者而言恐怕不是一个问题。存在即合理，世界只有一个，那它就是最好的，没有不完美的世界。但是，由于没人是纯粹的理想主义，也没人是纯粹的现实主义，所以这个问题是有必要讨论的。

This might not be an issue for those realists. Existence is justified, and there is only one world, which makes it the best one—there are no imperfect worlds. However, as no one is purely an idealist, and no one is purely a realist, it is necessary to discuss this question.

<p><br></p>

首先，1984不是最差的世界。至少一个人是可以庸庸碌碌地生活一生。老大哥为每一个忠于他的人安排了还不错的路线。如果我是一个生活在活人祭祀的部落的奴隶，或者我在嗜杀的暴君手下工作，又或者我生活在大饥荒，大瘟疫，大屠杀，世界大战中，那我几乎不可能掌握自己的命运，而周围大多数人的命运又很明显地，很惨。如果生活在那种世界中，也许，无论我做什么决定都几乎无法影响我的命运。也许所有人都只能认命躺平，得过且过。

First of all, "1984" is not the worst world. At least, one can live a bland and uneventful life in it. Big Brother provides an acceptable life for everyone who is loyal to him. If I were a slave in a tribe that practices human sacrifice, or if I worked under a bloodthirsty tyrant, or if I lived during a great famine, plague, massacre, or world war, then I would hardly have control over my own destiny, and it would be fairly obvious that the fate of most people around me is miserable. In such a world, any decision I make would hardly impact my destiny, and perhaps everyone could only accept their fate and muddle through.

<p><br></p>

有人会说，你生活在21世纪的文明国家中，你已经生活得够好了，国家已经付出了这么多，你再要求你的生活完美是不是太过分了？对此，我认为，其他人过的更差不是我应该过的差的理由。对于国家，我要求它止于至善。

Some might say that living in a civilized country in the 21st century is already good enough, and the nation has put in so much effort; isn't it too much to ask for a perfect life? In response to this, I believe that others' worse situations are not a reason for me to live poorly. For the nation, I demand it to only strive when excellence.

<p><br></p>

又扯远了。我认为，想要在1984的世界活下去，**重要的是，不要太完美主义**。不能说“我过不上最好的日子，我就干脆连一般的日子都不过了。”

Back to the main topic again. I believe that to survive in a world like "1984", **one can't pursue perfection too much**. Don't think, "If I can't have the best life, I might as well not live a normal life." 

<p><br></p>

此外，不要尝试抗争，除非你能从中获益。国家对人没有恩，所以没有人应该爱国（但有时要装出爱国的样子），尤其是爱国会对自己造成危险的情况下。以爱国为理由抗争老大哥是愚蠢的。由于1984是一个戒备森严的警察世界，在没有外部干扰下，妄图挑战老大哥只会让自己白白牺牲，并且增加他们预防挑战的经验。极权统治的能力只会越来越大，反抗它的成功率也只会越来越小。生活在1984的世界里，请认命。

Moreover, don't attempt to resist unless you can benefit from it. The state does no favors for its people, so no one should be patriotic (though sometimes you have to put on a show of patriotism), especially when patriotism puts oneself in danger. Resisting Big Brother for the sake of patriotism is foolish. Since "1984" is a strictly surveilled police world, challenging Big Brother without outside interference will only result in one's senseless sacrifice, adding to their experience of preventing challenges. The power of totalitarian rule would only grow stronger, and the success rate of resistance would only get smaller. In a world like "1984," please accept it.

<p><br></p>

此外，在正常社会里与其他人互帮互助很正常，但这里是1984，因为其他人对我没有恩，我没有理由为了他们以身犯险。以爱人民为理由抗争老大哥更是愚蠢的。这就是极权统治下公民社会的原子化，但是这是每个个人能做出的最佳选择。但是我自认为我会把枪口抬高一寸，一是为了良心，二是为了老大哥倒台后的审判。

Furthermore, even it's possible and normal to help and cooperate with others in a normal society, but in "1984," for others don't owe me anything, I have no reason to risk myself for them. Resisting Big Brother on the grounds of loving the people is even more foolish. This is the atomization of civil society under totalitarian rule, but it's the best choice for each individual. However, I admit that I would raise the gun barrel by an inch, both for my conscience and for the judgment after Big Brother falls.

如果可以的话，请抛弃掉自己的那套善恶观，至少要承认老大哥不是彻头彻尾的坏，还是有人喜欢这套制度的。即使是1984的世界也是千人千面的世界，一千个读者眼中有一千个老大哥。也正因为如此，没有理由为了改变谁反抗这个世界。如果实在是抛弃不掉自己的那一套价值观的话，也要假装与大家一致。

If possible, please abandon one's own views on good and evil, or at least acknowledge that the system isn't entirely bad and that some people do like it. Even in the world of "1984", it is a world with diverse perspectives and a thousand readers see a thousand different Big Brothers. Because of this, there's no reason to resist this world to change someone else. If you really can't abandon your views, at least pretend to be in agreement with everyone else.

<p><br></p>

最后，有人会问，那邪恶就可以无法无天为非作歹吗？我的回答是，是的，甚至这就是邪恶的定义之一。另外，其实很难证明一个政权是邪恶的。往往是没有邪恶的政权，只有落后的，与人民的价值观不符的政权。（没我不认为纳粹是邪恶的。它只是与主流价值观不符。因为如果纳粹思想在全世界传播100年以上，种族歧视的概念将深入人心。）（但是由于纳粹明显不能保证所有的人都能正常生活，所以纳粹不是一个现代思想。）

Lastly, some might ask, so, just let the evil has its way and commit wrongdoing as it pleases? My answer is yes, and this is even one of the definitions of evil. Moreover, it's actually difficult to prove that a regime is evil. Often, there are no evil regimes, only those that are backward or don't align with the people's values. (I don't consider the Nazis evil either. They are simply not in line with mainstream values. Because if Nazi ideas had spread worldwide for over 100 years, the concept of racial discrimination would be deeply ingrained in people's minds.) (However, the Nazi regime does fall short of being a modern ideology since it obviously can't guarantee a normal life for everyone.)

老大哥万岁。

Long live my Big Brother.

另外，这是Tennisbot对于这个问题的回答。

如何在一个1984一般的极权世界里过上更好的生活？  
在一个1984式的极权社会中，要过上更好的生活，可以尝试以下策略：  
1. 保持低调：尽量避免引起注意，不要挑战权威或抱怨政府。  
2. 了解规则：了解这个社会的规则和法律，尽量遵守它们，以免惹上麻烦。  
3. 培养信任的朋友圈：结交一些可靠的朋友，互相支持和帮助。但要谨慎，因为可能会有间谍或密探。  
4. 寻找乐趣：在这种情况下，生活可能很压抑，所以要寻找短暂的快乐。比如阅读、画画、写日记等。  
5. 保持身心健康：锻炼身体，保持健康的生活习惯。同时，尽量保持乐观的心态，避免陷入沮丧。  
6. 学会自保：在这种社会中，任何人都可能是危险的，所以要学会保护自己，如学习防身术等。  
7. 寻求改变：如果觉得生活无法忍受，可以寻求逃离这个社会，或者加入反抗组织，争取改变局势  

By the way, this is the answer to the question by Tennisbot(based on gpt4).  

How to live the best possible life in a totalitarian world like "1984"?   
In a 1984-style totalitarian society, to live a better life, you can try the following strategies:  
1. Keep a low profile: Avoid drawing attention, don't challenge authority or complain about the government.  
2. Understand the rules: Learn the rules and laws of this society and follow them as much as possible to avoid trouble.  
3. Cultivate a circle of trusted friends: Make reliable friends for mutual support and help. But be cautious, because there might be spies or informants.  
4. Look for joy: In this situation, life can be oppressive, so find brief moments of happiness, such as reading, painting, or writing a diary.  
5. Maintain physical and mental health: Exercise, maintain healthy habits, and try to stay optimistic to avoid falling into depression.  
6. Learn to protect yourself: In this society, anyone can be dangerous, so learn to protect yourself, such as learning self-defense techniques.  
7. Seek change: If life becomes unbearable, consider escaping from this society or joining a resistance organization to fight for change.
