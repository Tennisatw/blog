有一个段子，说的是：晚上吃饭时，一个半生不熟的朋友跟我说，美国太不是东西了，跟我们打贸易战。“我们不惜一切代价，也要打赢贸易战”。我心想，你也不照镜子看看自己，你是那个“我们”吗？其实你就是那个“代价”。

There is a joke that goes like this: While having dinner one evening, an acquaintance who I barely know said to me, "America is such a jerk, starting a trade war with us. 'We will spare no cost to win this trade war.'" I thought to myself: have you even looked in the mirror? Are you part of that "we"? You're probably just part of the "cost".

段子当然是有些夸张。但是，不知道大家看完之后是否想过同样的问题：我们什么时候是“我们”，什么时候是“代价”？再进一步问，我们是谁，应该为谁说话？用通俗的话说就是：人的屁股和脑袋应该在哪里？

The joke is somewhat exaggerated. But after reading it, has anyone thought about this question: when are we the "we" and when are we the "cost"? Furthermore, who are we, and whom should we speak for?

“我们是谁” 相对好回答，它问的是身份问题。它的答案可能是民族身份，国家（包括区域，市县）身份，阶级身份，性别身份，宗教身份，兴趣身份，职业身份，思想身份（左派/右派）等等。此外，人的身份问题往往是复杂的，比如，马前卒同时是中国人，河北人，媒体人，男性，满族，无神论者，左派，政治爱好者。

"Who are we" is relatively easier to answer, as it addresses the issue of identity. The answer might involve ethnic identity, national (including regional, city, county) identity, class identity, gender identity, religious identity, interest-based identity, professional identity, ideological identity (left-wing/right-wing), and so on. Moreover, a person's identity is often complex. For instance, Ma Qianzu(马前卒) can simultaneously be Chinese, from Hebei, a media person, male, Manchu, an atheist, a leftist, and a political enthusiast.

而“应该为谁说话”，这个问题比较复杂。在键政中，人说话的主要目的是为了捍卫自己的政治立场。决定人的政治立场的可能是其民族，国家，阶级，性别身份，但也可能是他自己的政治理论。

人固然会本能地为自己的身份说话，比如，争取民族独立的人往往是本民族的人，争取女性权益的人也往往是女性。但是，人也会因为自己的政治理论而热爱某一团体，为其说话。恩格斯怎么说都是资产阶级，工厂主的儿子，但他却是马克思主义的奠基人。林毅夫为台湾人，但毅然“叛逃”到大陆担任经济学者。屁股不一定决定脑袋，认为“脑袋只会被屁股决定”是一种懒惰的思维方式。

As for "whom should we speak for," this question is more complex. In political discourse, the main purpose of speaking is often to defend one's political stance. A person's political stance may be determined by their ethnicity, nationality, class, gender identity, or their own political theory.

People naturally tend to speak for their own identity. For example, those fighting for national independence are often from that nation, and those advocating for women's rights are often women. However, individuals may also champion a group because of their political beliefs. Engels, for instance, was undeniably part of the bourgeoisie and the son of a factory owner, yet he was a founding figure of Marxism. Lin Yifu was Taiwanese but resolutely "defected" to the mainland to serve as an economist. Loyalties do not necessarily dictate beliefs; thinking that "beliefs are solely determined by loyalties" is a lazy mindset.

所有的身份认同，和所有的立场，只要是出于理性，就没有高下之分。然而有时，政府，或家族族长，或网络上的意见领袖等人，可能会出于政治宣传，而强调某一种身份或某一种立场超出其他的身份和立场（包括强化阶级叙事，讲好中国故事，美国梦，等等）。理性人们要认清这一点。

All forms of identity and all stances, as long as they are based on rationality, have no inherent hierarchy. However, sometimes governments, family patriarchs, online opinion leaders, and others may emphasize one identity or stance over others for political propaganda (such as reinforcing class narratives, promoting the "China story," or the "American dream"). As rational individuals, we need to recognize this.
