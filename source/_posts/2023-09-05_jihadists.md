[《陌生人——柴静对话圣战分子》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4otYJGByic)是一系列视频，总共有6集。

["Stranger: Talking to Jihadists"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4otYJGByic) is a video series consisting of six episodes in total.

这是一套非常有深度的与圣战恐怖分子的采访及对话。我们会认为他们是逻辑混乱，没有良知的人，但柴静用圣战分子的话向我们揭示了圣战分子的世界。视频中从各个方面分析了圣战分子的来源，想法，做事动机。令我相当佩服的一点是，她真的能找到并采访到各种各样的恐怖分子，让他们亲口说出他们的故事和逻辑，而不是借由第三者之口把他们描述成暴徒，或用定制的理论对他们的行为进行简单解释。

This is an incredibly profound series of interviews and conversations with jihadist terrorists. We may perceive them as illogical and immoral, but Chai Jing uses the words of the jihadists themselves to reveal their world. The videos analyze the origins, thoughts, and motivations of jihadists from various angles. One aspect I greatly admire is her ability to find and interview a wide range of terrorists, allowing them to share their stories and logic firsthand, rather than portraying them as thugs through third-party accounts or simply using some theories to explain them.

柴静说：“人们认为恐怖分子是疯子，但从我采访的感受来看，他们不是精神病学意义上的疯狂，杀人，是推理的结果：人类立法者是假神，宗教就成了政治，暴力就成了表达虔诚的最高方式。地狱天堂作为奖惩制度，杀人自毁就成了功利计算。一旦进入，他们的逻辑轨道就完全封闭。”因为害怕下地狱而参加圣战救赎自己，我理解他们的逻辑（但不认同）。

Chai Jing said, "People think terrorists are madmen, but from my interviews, they are not insane in the psychiatric sense. Their murders are the result of logical reasoning: human law-makers are false gods, religion has become politics, and violence the ultimate expression of devotion. Heaven and hell have become a system of reward and punishment, thus murder and self-destruction have become a utilitarian calculation. Once they're in, their logic becomes completely enclosed." I understand their logic of joining a holy war for redemption due to the fear of hell (though I do not agree with it).

这个视频特别有条理，一看就是学院派，我就喜欢这种井井有条的样子。此外，柴静每一个问题都问到了我的心坎里。每当对一件事情有疑问时，她都会把它问出来。综上，神作。

The videos are very well organized, it's clear they have an academic approach, which I really appreciate. Also, Chai Jing manages to ask questions that touch upon my deepest concerns. Whenever there's a doubt about anything, she addresses it. In a word, it's a masterpiece.
