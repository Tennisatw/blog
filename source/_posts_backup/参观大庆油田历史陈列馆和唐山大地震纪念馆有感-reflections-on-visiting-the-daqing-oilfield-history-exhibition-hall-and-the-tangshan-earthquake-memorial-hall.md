 我相当讨厌两件事，一个是强制奉献，一个是丧事喜办。

There are two things I detest rather deeply: one is compulsory sacrifice, and the other is glossing over tragedies with celebrations.

  

先说强制奉献。

Let's begin with the idea of compulsory sacrifice.

  

强制奉献从逻辑上就是不道德的，但是，自愿（向集体）奉献听起来就合理了很多。我们的宣传（包括但不限于陈列馆和新闻联播）的叙事逻辑喜欢把强制奉献包装成自愿向集体奉献。

Compulsory sacrifice is, logically, unethical. However, voluntarily dedicating oneself to the collective seems far more palatable. Our propaganda narratives (including, but not limited to, exhibitions and news broadcasts) tend to disguise compulsory sacrifice as voluntary contributions to the collective.

  

说到强制，各位生活在中国的人都清楚，不是所有的义务劳动义务奉献都可以拒绝。有些跟单位评优挂钩，有些跟个人荣誉有关，还有些纯是为了避免被周围人排挤。如果一件没说一定要做的事情在各单位评比完成进度，那么这件事情还是一定要做，参考青年大学习。在这个国家，恐怕所有的自愿奉献都有一定的强制性。

In the context of compulsion, those living in China understand clearly that not all obligatory labors or sacrifices can be shirked. Some are tied to work evaluations, others linked to personal honor, and still more simply done to avoid social ostracization. If there's a task which isn't explicitly mandatory, yet it impacts work assessments, then one is essentially obliged to do it. Referencing the "Youth Study" scenario, in this country, I'm afraid, there's a certain level of compulsion in every "voluntary" sacrifice.

  

奉献的对象也被偷换了。一个集体中谁的获益最高？如果所有人都获得一样的抽成，或者老弱病残获得更多，我都无话可说。但是大多数集体还是领导（也包括更上级的领导）获利更多嘛。所以向集体奉献，本质上是向上级，向领导奉献。

The object of dedication has also been quietly replaced. Who benefits most from the collective? If everyone receives an equal share, or if the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled receive more, I would have nothing to complain about. But in most collectives, it is the leaders (including those at higher levels) who benefit the most. Therefore, contributing to the collective is essentially a tribute to the higher-ups, to the leaders.

  

在这一点上，我只觉得铁人可怜，工作强度太大，导致没时间陪家人孩子，自己也病倒了。铁人可能是自愿的，那学习铁人的人也是自愿的吗？铁人精神和人性不冲突吗？

In this respect, I can only feel sorry for Wang Jinxi, the "Iron Man", whose intense workloads leave them no time to spend with their families or children and often result in illness. While the Iron Man might be volunteering, are those learning from him also volunteering? Does the Iron Man spirit not conflict with human nature?

  

我不排斥集体主义，但是前提是这个集体是我自愿选择的，分配模式合理，并且我可以自由退出。否则，我不愿意哪怕为这个集体流一滴汗。

I do not reject collectivism, but the premise is that I voluntarily choose the collective, the distribution mode is fair, and I can freely exit. Otherwise, I would not even want to sweat a drop for the collective.

  

此外，稍微跑个题，当陈列馆在鼓吹大干快上，并且根本没有提到当年是否虚报了产量时，我就知道，某单位没有从大跃进中学到一点教训。

Also, slightly off-topic, when the exhibition loudly advocate for rapid development, and fail to mention whether production figures were falsified, I know that some organizations have not learned their lessons from the Great Leap Forward.

  

再来谈谈丧事喜办。

Let's discuss the practice of celebrating funerals.

  

这种东西往小了说其实没什么，甚至可能本心是好的，为了让大家不要沉缅于悲痛之中，化悲愤为力量。但是往大了说，党和政府是否在干涉我们的情绪？

In essence, this approach might seem rather trivial. Its original intention could even be considered kindhearted, aiming to prevent people from being consumed by sorrow, transforming grief into strength. However, when viewed from a broader perspective, it raises the question of whether the Party and the government are manipulating our emotions.

  

2021年夏天，郑州大洪水距今已经2年了。2周年祭日的时候，出事的地铁站不允许人们送花（来源：推特 李老师不是你老师）。我们表达情绪的需求没有得到尊重，在可给可不给的自由上，政府的选择一向是不给。

It's been two years since the devastating floods in Zhengzhou in the summer of 2021. During the second anniversary, people were not allowed to bring flowers to the affected subway station (source: Twitter, @whyyoutouzhele). Our need to express our emotions was disregarded. When it comes to granting or withholding freedom, the government's choice seems to always tilt towards withholding.

说回唐山大地震纪念馆，我在参观的时候没看到对房屋质量的追责，也没看到除了官方之外民间的救援力量（或者有但是没放在重点位置），有点对地震的科普但是不够，纪念馆里用了三分之一的展厅讲解放军和各界人士的救援，还用了另外三分之一的展厅讲习近平和唐山如今的发展（我认为有点多了）。

Turning to the Tangshan Earthquake Memorial, during my visit, I noticed a lack of accountability for the quality of the housing. There was little evidence of non-official local rescue efforts (or if there were any, they were not given prominence). While there was some information about earthquakes, it wasn't sufficient. One third of the exhibition space was dedicated to the People's Liberation Army and other sectors' rescue efforts, while another third was devoted to Xi Jinping and the current development of Tangshan (which I think was a bit excessive).

  

丧事喜办可能也与中国传统文化有关。传统讲究哀而不伤，节哀顺变，甚至讨论死了人的时候都要尽可能的避讳。只能说，我们离现代化还有很长的路要走。

The practice of celebrating funerals might be associated with traditional Chinese culture. Traditionally, Chinese culture emphasizes expressing grief without being overcome by it, or in other words, mourning in moderation. There's even a tendency to avoid talking about death as much as possible. All we can say is, there's still a long way to go in our journey towards modernization.
