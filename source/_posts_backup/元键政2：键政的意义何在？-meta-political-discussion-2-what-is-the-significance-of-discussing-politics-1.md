When discussing political issues with my mom, she often comments: "What's the point of all this talk? Please focus on managing your own affairs."

  

In democratic countries, political discussions have significance: the votes of ordinary citizens steer the future direction of the nation. Yet what about authoritarian nations, particularly those where political discussion carries risk?

  

I believe political discussion remains meaningful. There are two key reasons for this. Firstly, it enhances individual knowledge and political literacy. Secondly, it gathers like-minded people together to unify. Both these reasons fundamentally aim to strengthen the power of **civil society**, thereby empowering citizens to a degree where they can challenge the party or government's authority.

  

There's no denying that the average knowledge level in China, particularly in the arena of politics, remains relatively low. For instance, many politically passionate individuals fail to comprehend the differences between a presidential system and a parliamentary one (simply because it isn't taught). Their understanding of capitalism often remains rooted in outdated Marxist descriptions again, dictated by what is presented in the curriculum, indicating that political education is poorly executed, intentionally or not.

  

To counter this deficiency in political education, high-level forums to debate politics prove necessary, even if they merely serve to expose the diversity of political thought. Participating in political discussions essentially provides exposure to a variety of philosophies, nuanced argument uncovers truth and eventually, political enthusiasts will identify the ideologies they truly resonate with, refining their own political theories over time. Even for patriots, engaging in political discussions enables them to justify national actions from a more informed perspective, acting as defenders of the state, whereas patriots with limited political literacy will simply equateany unfamiliar ideologies to dissent.

  

In addition, political discussions also serve to counter societal atomization: the phenomenon where interpersonal relationships worsen, much like molecules decomposing into atoms. In the modern world, bonding due to familial ties or place of birth weakens which is definitely a situation welcomed by autocratic governments. Citizens aiming to oppose governmental decisions often band together, for example, 'paper revolutions' to protest unjust lockdown protocols. Debating politics gives citizens an opportunity to gather based on shared political views, potentially forming new political groups or parties.

  

Whether in democratic or authoritarian countries, politics is a process of strategic interplay of various forces. The Chinese party/government is not a unified bloc, it sometimes makes concessions to appease public resentment, as was the case with the 'paper revolution.' Protests and demonstrations can also serve as tools employed by open-minded members of the party to challenge conservative factions. The stronger the power of civil society, the greater the influence on party/governmental decisions, underlying the significance of engaging in political debates.
