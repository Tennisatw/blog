不用害怕任何演讲，所谓的害怕全都是由于准备不足。本文会给出一些小tips，让大家在准备演讲的时候，用更少的精力去准备得更充分。

本文主要针对的是学术类别的演讲，但是其实所有种类的演讲都大体适用。

There's no need to fear any presentation; the so-called fear is all due to insufficient preparation. Here are some tips to help you prepare more efficiently and effectively for your presentations.

This article is primarily focused on academic presentations, but the principles generally apply to all types of presentations.

  

如果可能的话，要自己写演讲稿。以你自己熟悉的表达方法为主。如果演讲是英语的话，适当用一点点更地道或者更专业的表达方法，但绝对不能多用。除了专有名词外，尽量少用生僻的词汇和高级词汇。无论怎么说，演讲绝对不是背诵，必须要先了解自己讲的东西，才能讲得好。

在写好稿子之后，把它抄在ppt的注释里。

If possible, write your own speech. Use expressions you're familiar with. If the presentation is not in your first language, sprinkling in some authentic or professional phrases sparingly. Avoid obscure and advanced vocabulary, except for specific terminology. Remember, a speech is not about recitation; you must understand your topic to speak well about it.

After writing your speech, copy it into the notes section of your PowerPoint slides.

  

写好稿子之后，照着稿子自己顺一遍。想到什么说什么，超时也没关系，而不是简单地念稿。在这一过程中，尽量不要一直盯着ppt和稿子。如果感觉还是不熟，就等一段时间之后再顺几遍。

Once the speech is written, go through it on your own. Speak freely, going off-script is fine, and don't just read it verbatim. Try not to constantly look at your slides or script during this process. If you still feel unprepared, go through it a few more times after taking a break.

  

演讲的时候完全可以读稿，甚至完全可以从头读到尾。其实几乎没人在乎你是读的还是背的。

During the presentation, it's completely fine to read from your script, even from start to finish. In reality, almost nobody cares whether you are reading or have memorized it.
