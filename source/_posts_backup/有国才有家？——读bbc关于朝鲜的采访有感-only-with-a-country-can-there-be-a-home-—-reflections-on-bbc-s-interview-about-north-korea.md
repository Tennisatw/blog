问题：为什么西方人会自私到不能理解“有国才有家”？

问题简介：我们中国人都能知道为了国家要三过家门而不入，全家牺牲在战场上也要为国捐躯，西方人怎么被普世价值洗脑得这么彻底？？？

回答：有国不一定有家（一张波尔布特的照片）

Question: Why are Westerners so selfish that they can't understand "Only with a country, can there be a home"?

Question Description: We Chinese know that for the sake of our country, we would pass our house three times without entering, and even sacrifice our entire family on the battlefield. How can Westerners be so thoroughly brainwashed by universal values???

Answer: Having a country doesn't necessarily mean having a home (a photo of Pol Pot).

  

2023年6月18日，bbc发布了一个有关朝鲜的采访。里面描述了3个朝鲜普通民众描述她们的日子变得越来越艰难，朝鲜甚至有人正在被饿死。

On June 18, 2023, BBC published an interview about North Korea. It described how the lives of three ordinary North Korean citizens were becoming increasingly difficult, to the point where some people in North Korea were even dying of hunger.

写这篇文章的时候，我正好在首尔，这座城市离朝鲜只有40公里，就在我给我妹妹买韩式化妆品，抱怨机场的石锅拌饭难吃又贵的时候，北面40公里处，就有人正在饿死。

By the way, As I write this article, I happen to be in Seoul, a city just 40 kilometers away from North Korea. While I was buying Korean cosmetics for my cousin sister and complaining about the expensive and tasteless bibimbap at the airport, people 40 kilometers north of me were starving to death.

  

让我们稍稍考虑一下这个问题：国家权力凌驾于正义之上吗？或者说，当国家的行为不正义的时候，人应该选择国家，还是选择正义呢？

Let's briefly consider this question: Does national power take precedence over justice? Or to put it another way, should people choose the state or justice when the actions of the state are unjust?

  

我相信选择国家的人（我相信在中国，这种人占多数）会认为，西方势力亡我之心不死，而国家在保护我们民族免受外族侵犯。所以要给与国家最高的权力，同时防止被普世价值洗脑。

I believe those who choose the state (I believe they are the majority in China) would argue that the Western powers have an undying intent to destroy us, and the state protects our nation from foreign aggression. Therefore, we should give the highest power to the state and prevent being brainwashed by universal values.

  

在批判它之前，我首先承认，这个逻辑是通顺的。但是它有一个致命问题，那就是，怎么保证这不是陷入了国家叙事的陷阱呢？如果另一个人生活在西方，但相信黄祸论，认为中国亡我之心不死，并认为里面的人被共产主义洗脑了。这两类想法本质上有什么区别吗？此外，无论是西方，还是中国（还是任何别的思想潮流），都是复杂的，想要找到双方的打压对手和与对手合作的示例都有很多，与其说西方亡我之心不死，不如说双方是竞争与合作并存的关系。

Before criticizing it, I firstly admit that this logic is coherent. However, it has a fatal flaw: how to ensure that we are not falling into the trap of the state narrative? If another person lives in the West, but believes in the Yellow Peril, thinks that China is intent on destroying them, and believes that people there have been brainwashed by communism. Is there any essentially different between these two kinds of thoughts? Moreover, both the West and China (or any other ideological trend) are complex. There are plenty of examples of both suppressing opponents and cooperating with the other. It's more accurate to say that the relationship is one of coexistence between competition and cooperation, rather than one side is intent on destroying the other.

  

如果剖析一下“国家”的话，会发现，它总是需要一个理由，让我们选择它。可以是民族，宗教，或者是共同的价值观（民族国家/宗教国家/美西方国家）。但是无论是民族，还是宗教，还是价值观，都没有崇高到不能批判的地步。把自己神化而使人们尊敬畏惧国家的君主，在中世纪一抓一大把。而且历史上来说，没有哪个政权是神圣不朽的，连超过500年的都不多。

If we analyze the concept of "state," we find that it always needs a reason to make us choose it. It could be ethnicity, religion, or shared values (ethnic states/religious states/Western states). But whether it is ethnicity, religion, or values, none is so sacred that it can't be criticized. Monarchs who deify themselves to instill respect and fear in the people were a dime a dozen in the Middle Ages. Historically, no regime is immortal, and even those lasting more than 500 years are not many.

  

顺便说一下，因为金正恩是主体革命的独一无二继承人暨领导者，所以将军的恩情永远还不完。

By the way, because Kim Jong Un is the unique successor and leader of the Juche Revolution, the gratitude towards the general can never be fully repaid.

  

在bbc的文章的最后一段，作者写道：

我们把我们的调查结果提交给朝鲜政府。该国驻伦敦大使馆的代表说：“你们收集到的信息并非完全符合事实，因为它是来自反朝鲜民主主义人民共和国势力捏造的证言。即使在困难时期，朝鲜始终把人们的利益放在第一位，并坚定不移地维护人民的福祉......即使面对考验和挑战，人民的福祉都是我们的第一要务。”

In the last paragraph of the BBC article, the author writes:

"We put our findings to the North Korean government, which told us it "has always prioritised the interests of the people, even at difficult times".

"The people's well-being is our foremost priority, even in the face of trials and challenges," said a representative from the North Korean embassy in London.

They also said the information was "not entirely factual", claiming it had been "derived from fabricated testimonies from anti-DPRK \[Democratic People's Republic of Korea\] forces"."

  

可能有人会质疑，那你为什么就一定认为是朝鲜官员在说谎，而不是bbc在做假新闻呢？我的回答是，因为这句话我见过。在三年大饥荒的时候。

Some people might question, why do you assume that it's the North Korean officials lying, not the BBC producing fake news? My answer is, because I've heard this statement before. During the The Great Chinese Famine.

  
我一贯认为没有邪恶的政权，只有落后的思想。但是，如果一个政权连维持它的人民的生机都做不到了，而且明明可以有外界的援助，却因为种种原因不予接受，视人命于草芥。这属于政府的极度不负责的行为，评价一句故意杀人，我相信都不为过。而这种政权，不值得人去爱。

I always believe there are no evil regimes, only backward thoughts. However, if a regime can't even sustain the lives of its people, and despite the availability of foreign aid, refuses to accept it for various reasons, treating human lives as grass mustards. This is an extreme irresponsibility on the part of the government, and it wouldn't be too far to say it's deliberate killing. Such a regime is not worth the love of their people.

  

最后感慨一句，从来不是哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。压迫的强度太大，人们可能会不敢反抗。压迫的时间太久，这个民族，恐怕就会失去反抗的本能。

Finally, I would like to reflect that it's not always true that where there is oppression, there will be resistance. If the intensity of oppression is too high, people may not dare to resist. And if the oppression lasts too long, the nation, I fear, may lose its instinct to resist.

  

与君共勉

Wishing you strength,
