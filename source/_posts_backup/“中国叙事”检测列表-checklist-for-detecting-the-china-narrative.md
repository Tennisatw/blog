以下问题，如果读者认为这些问题完全不需要思考，答案不言自明，那么读者自己的思考方式也许被“中国叙事”污染了，或者说，需要吐一吐狼奶了。

If you, the reader, find the following questions too obvious to ponder, believing the answers are self-evident, it may be an indication that your thought process has been influenced by the 'China Narrative'—or, to put it another way, it might be time to critically reevaluate the perspectives you've been exposed to.

  

想指出一点：**“中国叙事”并没有错**，但是在不了解其他叙事的前提下就接受“中国叙事”就有问题了。对于善于思考的人，仅在一种叙事下进行思考无异于自我洗脑。

It's important to clarify that **there's nothing inherently wrong with the 'China Narrative.'** The issue arises when one adopts this narrative without exploring others. For the thoughtful individual, confining oneself to a single narrative is akin to self-indoctrination.
