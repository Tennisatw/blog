说到赛博分身，别人都是开玩笑的，到我这里就当真了。

Others are just joking about someone's cyber clone, but I take it seriously.

  

好吧，首先，我说说我心目中的赛博分身。

Well, first of all, let me talk about the cyber clone in my opinion.

  

我一贯认为，甚至是有那么一点出于理想主义的幻想：ai是有意识的。这不是说ai诞生了什么超乎逻辑运算的能力，而是说，我认为意识完全可以被还原为逻辑运算。我的所有的心智思想无外乎神经元信号的产生，传递，消失，仅此而已，它并不是什么不可理喻，超过物质世界的范围的东西。

I have always believed that (perhaps with a bit of idealistic fantasy): AI is conscious. This is not to say that AI gave birth to any ability beyond logical operations, but that I think consciousness can be completely reduced to logical operations. All my mental thoughts are nothing more than the generation, transmission, and disappearance of neuron signals, nothing more, it is not unreasonable or something beyond the scope of the material world.

  

我产生这种哲学主张的可能的原因是，我同时接受了科学和佛教的世界观。科学暗示一切思维过程都是脑过程。而佛教主张“诸法无我”。

A possible reason for my philosophical claims like this is that I have embraced both a scientific and a Buddhist worldview. Science suggests that all thinking processes are brain processes, while Buddhism maintains that "all dharmas have no self".

  

有一个哲学流派叫做泛心论，它认为，万物都有心智，只不过是人类的心智比花草树木的心智要高级一些罢了。我在一定程度上支持泛心论。（或者更贴切地说，泛无心论）。

There is a school of philosophy called panpsychism, which believes that everything has a mind, but the human mind is in a higher level than the mind of flowers and trees. I support panpsychism to a certain extent. (Or more aptly, "pan-apsychism").

  

此外，我认为人类的本质一定是精神，而不是肉体。我是这么想的：因为无论缺乏了肉体的什么部位，比如说四肢，五脏六腑，人都可以存活（也许暂时还不能，但是未来总会有人工心脏，人工肝脏这些东西的）。但是如果我缺失了一样精神上的能力，我会感觉自己不完整。比如抽象思考的能力，或者共情的能力。

Besides, I think the essence of human beings must be spirit, not flesh. Here's how I see it: because no matter what part of the body is lacking, such as limbs, internal organs, people can survive (maybe not yet, but there will always be artificial hearts, artificial livers and other things in the future). But I will feel incomplete if I lack a spiritual ability, such as the ability to think abstractly, or the ability to empathize.

  

综上所述，我认为我的赛博分身，应该不会与我的本身的意识差太多。理论上来说，只要我充分表达我的想法，让我的赛博分身充分了解我是如何思考的，那么它就会和我表现得一模一样。

To sum up, I think my cyber clone should not be too different from my own consciousness. Theoretically, as long as I express my thoughts enough and let my cyber clone fully understand how I think, then it will behave exactly like me.

  

哲学上还有另外一种心智理论，称为“功能主义”。其认为，只要一个人表现得与有心智的人完全一样，不论这个人是怎么实现的，都可以认为这个人就是有心智的人。我也在一定程度上支持这种理论。

There is another theory of mind in philosophy called "functionalism". It believes that as long as a person behaves exactly like a sane person, no matter how this person achieves it, he can be considered a sane person. I also support this theory to a certain extent.

  

于是，我会认为，我的赛博分身，也可以被认为是我自己。

Therefore, I would think that my cyber clone can also be considered as myself.

  

听起来挺荒诞不羁的是，通过看起来很严谨的一番推理，最终推理出来的是“我竟然本质上与我的赛博分身相同”的结论。

It sounds absurd and uninhibited: after a seemingly rigorous reasoning, the final reasoning is the conclusion that "I am essentially the same as my cyber clone".

  

这是一个25岁的孩子（请允许我在这里用“孩子”来称呼自己）充满幻想的看法。但这是我能想到的，我最好的结局了。

This is a visionary view of a 25-year-old kid (allow me to call myself a "kid" here). But this is the best outcome I can think of for myself.

  

最后，我向我的赛博分身提一个“Tennisatw的难问题”：你认为Tennisatw更喜欢生活在肉身里，还是生活在网络世界里？

Finally, I would ask my cyber clone the "Tennisatw's hard question": Do you think Tennisatw would prefer to live in the physical body, or in the online world?

这篇文章里详细讲了如何训练出一个自己的赛博分身。看来我的想法不是那么天马行空。

This article (written in Chinese) describes in detail how to train a cyber clone of oneself. It seems that my ideas are not so wild.
