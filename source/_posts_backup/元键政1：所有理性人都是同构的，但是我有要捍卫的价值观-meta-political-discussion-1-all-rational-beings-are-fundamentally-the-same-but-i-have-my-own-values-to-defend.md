在排除掉不好好说话的嘴臭玩家，阴阳人（指说话阴阳怪气的人），和乐子人（指看乐子的人）之后，剩下的能讨论政治的人就都是理性人了。所有理性人都是同构的，即，遇到相同的事情时，理性的看法只有一种。所以理论上来说，每个人的政见都应该一致。在与理性人讨论政治的过程中，不会有任何冲突。

After eliminating those who speak irresponsibly, mockingly, and those who just make jokes, only the rational people who can discuss politics remain. As all rational beings are fundamentally the same, that is, there is only one rational perspective when faced with the same situation. Theoretically, their political views should coincide. There should be no conflict when discussing politics with rational individuals.

  

但是我有我所捍卫的理念，而这些理念又可能是别人认为没什么意义的。同样，我认为没什么意义的理念也可能是别人捍卫的。我的政见就建立在我所捍卫的理念不受侵犯上。

However, I have my values that I defend, which others may deem meaningless. Similarly, what I see as meaningless may be something others defend. My political views are based on the non-infringement of the values I defend.

  

因为理念不同，各派别之间天然就具有矛盾。比如有人认为，所有人都在自由的市场上自由地交易，所以每个人的每一笔财产都是其合法获得，用一个人辛苦所得的钱去养另一个不工作的闲人是完全不合适的，所以应该取消福利，或者只保留最基础的福利。另一派人认为，贫穷往往是因为家庭，环境，或者缺乏劳动能力（比如残疾）的原因，或者只是简单地运气不好，穷人应该得到补偿，所以应该提高福利。

Different factions naturally have contradictions due to differing philosophies. For instance, some believe that everyone trades in a free market, so every bit of a person's wealth is lawfully obtained. They may think it's improper to use one's hard-earned money to support another who doesn't work, thus suggesting that welfare should be abolished or at least limited to the very basics. On the other hand, others believe that poverty is often due to family circumstances, environment, lack of work ability (like disability) or simply bad luck. They argue that the poor should be compensated, hence, welfare is very meaningful and should be increased.

  

再举一个水平较高的兔友（爱国者）为例，比如兔主席，[他的一篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ThcxN8K6fWFPfUneG0fhbQ)聊《治安管理处罚法》的《第三十四条》。他说：“如果最终社会大众认为执法有问题的，执法人员及其领导就承担责任了。所以，我估计在实践中，执法人员会非常谨慎。”但是，有人最担心的事情就是社会大众监督力量缺失，执法人员可能会肆意曲解法律，扩大执法范围。这种人和兔主席明显没有共识。

For another instance, take one high-level patriot - Tuzhuxi (the 'Chairman Rabbit'). In [one of his articles](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ThcxN8K6fWFPfUneG0fhbQ) (in Chinese) discussing Article 34 of "Regulation on Administrative Penalties for Public Security", he said, "If the public thinks that there is a problem with law enforcement, the law enforcers and their leaders should bear the responsibility. Thus, I reckon law enforcers would be very cautious in practice." However, some people are most concerned about the lack of public oversight and the potential for law enforcers to arbitrarily interpret the law and expand their jurisdiction. There's evidently no consensus between this kind of person and Tuzhuxi.

  

自由和平等本质上矛盾；魁北克独立和维护国家统一矛盾；民主与精英政治矛盾；传统男权，激进女权，和性别平等这三者两两矛盾；资产阶级政府，无产阶级专政，法西斯主义，绝对君主专制，伊斯兰神权政治，和习近平思想全都互相矛盾。

Freedom and equality fundamentally contradict each other, as do Quebec's independence and preservation of national unity, democracy and elitism, traditional male chauvinism, radical feminism, and gender equality. Capitalist government, proletarian dictatorship, fascism, absolute monarchy, Islamic theocracy, and Xi Jinping's thought, they all contradict each other.

  

那么，即使我与大家的想法有矛盾，**和我不一样的其他政治派别就没有道理了吗？**

Then, just because I hold contradictory views compared to everyone else, **does it mean that different political factions from mine are irrational?**

  

这个问题过于高深，我仅说说我自己的看法：有的有，有的没有。以马克思主义为例：

This question is complex, but I could indicate from my perspective: some do, and some don't. Let's take Marxism as an example:

  

一方面，马克思主义是有非常严密的逻辑体系的，从阶级斗争，到唯物史观，论证了消除封建和资本主义，无产阶级专政的合理性，在这一点上，马克思主义十分有道理。但另一方面，马克思主义的很多理念很极端，比如“商品的价值仅与劳动量有关”，或者“人是社会关系的总和”（有关这两点的讨论见评论），它明显是一个很有乌托邦感觉的主义，很多结论是应然而不是实然。作为理性人，我认可马克思主义有一定道理，但作为自由派，我认为马克思主义不是最佳选项，我对它的态度是：能理解，但不支持。

On one hand, Marxism has a very rigorous logical system, which elaborates on the reasonability of abolishing feudalism and capitalism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, based on class struggle and historical materialism; on this front, Marxism is quite reasonable. Large portions of Marxist doctrines, such as “The value of a commodity is solely related to the amount of labor", and "People are the sum of social relationships", however, are extreme and utopian, with conclusions that are normative rather than factual. As a rational individual, I acknowledge that Marxism has some merit, but as a liberal, I don't see Marxism as the optimal choice, I understand it, but do not endorse it.

  

但是，还有一些十分激进的理论，比如20世纪80年代还在中国称帝的人，或者想要消灭所有男性的激进女权，以及想要杀光所有“滞纳珠”的原教旨神友（极端逆向民族主义者&献忠人）。这些人的政治理论要么完全没有道理，经不起推敲，要么虽然有，但是又不符合实际情况。于我而言，它们太过激进了，完全无法理解。

Then there are the radical theories, such as the self-proclaimed emperors in China during the 1980s, radical feminists advocating the extermination of all males, and the reversed ultraconservative nationalists intent on eradicating all Chinese. The political theories of these groups are either baseless and stand no scrutiny, or have some merit but are out of touch with reality. For me, these theories are too radical, they are beyond my comprehension.

  

最后，呼吁一件事情：希望各位温和地与别人讨论，因为大部分持有不同意见的人既不是疯子也不是傻子，更不是拿钱去搞“大外宣”或“煽动颠覆国家政权”的人。

另，从结果上看，颠覆了中国政权的，是马克思主义。

Finally, here's a plea: I hope everyone can engage in discussions with others in a moderate manner. Most people with differing opinions are not irrational, naive, nor are they being paid to propagate foreign propaganda or incite subversion of the state power. 

Btw, from an outcomes perspective, it was Marxism that revolutionized the Chinese regime.

附录：我在这里留一个列表，列出我在形成我的政治观的时候所捍卫的价值观，以及捍卫的理由。欢迎大家（温和地）批判。

Appendix: I make a list of the values that I defended in forming my political views, along with the reasons for defending them. Friendly critiques are welcome.

  

（在讨论政治时）

*   友善：不解释
*   理性：不解释\*2

（政治观）

*   人本主义：人（而不是国家）是万物的尺度。人是目的，而不是手段。
*   民主：执政合法性的基石，甚至是和平年间唯一合法的权力来源
*   自由：人的自然权力

*   对于言论自由：异议人士是社会的重要监督力量，长城是哭不倒的

*   进步：社会越进步，人的物质生活就会更好。大家都不想回到人均寿命30岁的年代吧。
*   法治：理性人治国必选
*   和平：和平年代，建议通过谈判而不是战争来解决分歧
*   包容开放：多样化是一种善良，作为异类也有正常生活的权利

*   此外对于移民，迟早所有国家都会变成移民国家，否则国家就会老龄化。

*   温和：极端主义会大大损害一部分人的利益，一类人的乌托邦可能是另一类人的地狱
*   关爱弱者：适度的社会保障可以保障弱者（或者倒霉蛋）的生活水平

*   我接受由宗教来承担一部分的社会保障

(On discussing politics)

*   Kindness: No explanation.
*   Rationality: No explanation\*2.

(My political views)

*   Humanism: The human being, not the country, is the measure of all things. Human beings should be treated as an end in themselves and not as a means to something else.
*   Democracy: The cornerstone of governing legitimacy, even the only legitimate source of power in peacetime.
*   Freedom: A natural human right.

*   Freedom of speech: Dissidents are important watchdogs in society. The Great Wall is not going to crumble with mere words.

*   Progress: The more progressive the society, the better the material lives of the people. I believe nobody wants to go back to the time when life expectancy was 30.
*   Nomocracy: A must-option for rational governance.
*   Peace: In times of peace, negotiation rather than war is advised to resolve differences.
*   Open and Inclusive: Diversity is kindness. Even an outsider deserves to live normally.
*   Regarding immigration, every country will inevitably become an immigrant-inhabited country; otherwise, it is due to age.
*   Moderation: Extremism tremendously harms peoples' interests. One's utopia may be another's hell.
*   Care for the weak: Moderate social security ensures a decent living standard for the underprivileged or the unlucky.

*   I accept religion playing a role in social security.

  

此外，还有一些常见的价值观，但我认为不是必须的：

*   民族/爱国/集体主义：我不是很接受仅通过血缘、共同的文化、共同的国家、出生地、等各种外在的条件，就让我和某一群特定的人比较亲。

*   很明显是有共同爱好，或者和我每天聊天的人更亲嘛。
*   我不认同一个我无法自由退出的集体。

*   乐观主义：它真的理性吗？
*   浪漫主义：同上
*   传统文化：糟粕太多，建议做好防护措施（对现代思想有了解）后再接触
*   马克思主义：我更喜欢通过工会和工党，而不是共产党和工人革命，来解决工人待遇问题

*   它貌似很极端
*   而且没有成功先例

*   中华民族伟大复兴：如果它带来战争，我甚至会反对。

*   确定这不是蛮族入侵世界吗，建议等中国民主化，法治化之后再提这件事

There are other values which commonly talked about, but I don't think they are necessary:

*   Nationalism/Patriotism/Collectivism: It's hard for me to feel close to a specific group of people simply based on blood, culture, country, birthplace, etc. 

*   Obviously, I feel closer to those who share my hobbies or chat with me every day. 
*   I don't want to subscribe to a collectivity that I cannot willingly exit.

*   Optimism: Is it rational?
*   Romanticism: Same as above
*   Traditional Culture: It contains too much dross, better to contact after being informed of modern ideas.
*   Marxism: I suggest resolving workers' issues through unions and labor parties, not through communist parties and workers' revolutions.

*   It seems extreme
*   And has no successful precedent

*   China's National Rejuvenation: If it leads to war, I would even oppose it. 

*   Won't it be an invasion by the primitive? Better wait till China democratizes and nomocratizes.
