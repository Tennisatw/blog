If you, the reader, find the following questions too obvious to ponder, believing the answers are self-evident, it may be an indication that your thought process has been influenced by the 'China Narrative'—or, to put it another way, it might be time to critically reevaluate the perspectives you've been exposed to.

  

It's important to clarify that **there's nothing inherently wrong with the 'China Narrative.'** The issue arises when one adopts this narrative without exploring others. For the thoughtful individual, confining oneself to a single narrative is akin to self-indoctrination.

  

Political Discussion Section

1.  **Who am I? When discussing politics, whose perspective should I adopt?**
2.  **Is one's stance always predetermined by their inherent biases?** (For example, can men support feminism? Can ordinary people adopt the perspective of a leader?)
3.  If men can support feminism, do they have the right to define it?
4.  Is there an absolute right and wrong in politics? If so, what are the criteria for judgment?
5.  Should there always be individuals who disagree with mainstream opinions, even on major issues?
6.  Are there topics that should never be discussed? (e.g., the morality of Nazism)

  

Nation/People Section

1.  What are the functions and differences between the nation, the party, and the government?
2.  How does the Communist Party of China represent the people?
3.  What are the benefits of national unity versus division? Should China consider splitting or adopting a federal system?
4.  Can a region secede from a federation autonomously?
5.  Should China pursue democracy? What are the pros and cons of democracy versus authoritarianism?
6.  If not adopting Western-style democracy, what constitutes Chinese-style democracy, and what is the fundamental definition of democracy?
7.  What are the advantages and disadvantages of populism versus elitism?
8.  How do the demands for governmental centralization differ between wartime and peacetime?
9.  Should the party control the military, or where should military power reside?
10.  To whom should power be accountable, and how is this ensured?
11.  Should there be checks and balances between different branches of power? Is the power of the state/people supreme?
12.  Is patriotism unconditional? Is it a virtue? Should one support their country even when it's in the wrong?
13.  Should a nation/the United Nations have the right to monitor/intervene in another country's internal affairs?

  

Propaganda/Public Opinion Section

1.  **Does public opinion shaped by propaganda still count as public opinion?** Is it worthy of respect?
2.  What constitutes brainwashing? Who has been brainwashed, and how can one determine if they've been brainwashed themselves?
3.  Should only state media comment on current affairs?
4.  Do the Chinese public and the official stance always align on their views of the United States?
5.  **What is freedom of speech? Should we strive for it, and where are its boundaries?**
6.  Is it ethical to encourage others to make sacrifices, including government promotion of patriotic sacrifice?
7.  Technically, could controlling the news to only report on the positive actions of the Japanese army during their invasion of China lead to Chinese support for them? How do we prove our opposition to the Japanese invasion isn't just due to being exposed only to their atrocities?

  

History Section

1.  Who creates history?
2.  Who should have the authority to define historical events? Can academia have different views after such definitions?
3.  Does being backward necessarily lead to exploitation? In what aspects, such as military strength? Are there examples where being backward did not lead to exploitation?
4.  **What were the causes of the Boxer Rebellion/the invasion by the Eight-Nation Alliance?**
5.  Was the Communist Party the only savior of China?
6.  Does power only emerge from the barrel of a gun? Is this statement still applicable today?
7.  What is "People's War"? Is involving civilians in warfare justifiable? Does this comply with the laws of war?
8.  What were the major achievements and failures of Deng Xiaoping?
9.  How is Nazism defined? What were its mistakes, and where did it go wrong?
10.  Should there be reparations for historical enslavement/genocide, and who should receive them?
11.  Does the impact of a massacre become more severe, and thus more unacceptable, the more recent it occurs?

  

Other

1.  "My ancestors have long stamped all that I am with the mark of China." Is the 'Chinese' imprint on Chinese people indelible?
2.  What are the advantages of collectivism versus individualism?
3.  Do I have the right to remain poor? Can I refuse poverty alleviation?
4.  Is religion still necessary in modern society?
5.  Is the wrongdoing of others/nations a justification for one's own shortcomings? When is it, and when is it not?
6.  **If I don't ponder these questions, where do my political views come from?** Can I rely on those views to make decisions/vote?
